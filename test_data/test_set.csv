64,my mother was diagnosed with left basal pneumonia she is 74 yeas old and was discharged from hospital yesterday was given amoxicillin and clarithromycin but now she is being sick and has diarohhea she has had amoxicillin before which hasnt effected her this way will it be the other antibiotics also what is left basal pneumonia,"thanks for your question on healthcare magic. i can understand your concern. in my opinion, her diarrhoea is mostly due to amoxicillin. amoxicillin can cause diarrhea on second exposure. so you should stop amoxicillin. there are options for oral antibiotics other than amoxicillin like cefixime, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin etc. and left basal pneumonia means lung infection in lower lobe of left lung. so antibiotics are the mainstay of treatment. hope i have solved your query. i will be happy to help you further. wishing good health to your mother.thanks."

71,"my mother was admitted to st. jude s last wednesday with pneumonia. she is 82 and also has copd and parkinson s. she was treated with antibiotics and released four days later. she is to continue with antibiotics treatment at her skilled nursing facility for another 7 days. the day after she returned to her skilled nursing facility, she was given a new roommate who has advanced pneumonia and in critical condition. a few days earlier, the doctor at the hospital said that my mother s pneumonia was negative and she was taken out of isolation. is it dangerous for my mother, who seems to be recovering or has recovered from her pneumonia, to be placed in the same room as a patient with advanced pneumonia?","hello,to be honest, there is a chance of cross infection from one person to another. however, this depends on so many factors and most of the infections, especially bacterial pneumonia, do not transmit easily. if more than one arm distance, the chance is very little and if not too close (like kissing etc.) the chance is further reduced. if two of them are already on antibiotics, as in your case, there is a chance but in the setting what u described, it is extremely unlikely. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further.regards, dr. mahboob ur rahman"
72,"how much will this cost? i have had pneumonia 8 time last year. not 1 specialist could find the bacteria causing this. by december of that year i almost passed away. i had just been dismissed by a hospital and sent home, and 1 hour layer i could barely breathe. i was filling up with fluid and foamy blood was coming out. the paramedics saved me and took me to another hospital the drs. found a serious heart condition, still waiting for open heart surgery. i fill up to my bronchials with fluid every few weeks, it bubbles up and i can hear gurgling. i have no lung problems, such as copd, or emphasyma. what can i do.","hello and welcome to ‘ask a doctor’ service.i have reviewed your query and here is my advice.as per your history and description, the possibility of end-stage heart disease leads to heart failure is more likely. surgical treatment is best for this. so try to get it done urgently as soon as possible.diuretics and other cardiac supportive drugs are advisable until surgery. so better to consult the cardiologist and try for early surgery.hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further.regards,dr. kaushal bhavsar"

76,can a cool mist vaporizer help with the corona virus since it doesn’t like humidity?,"not particularly. the facts are your nose & upper airway add humidity to the air you breathe to the point it reaches ~100% at the level of air exchange. vaporizers help loosen thicker mucus in the upper airways so you can cough it up, but it would not have any effect on the deep airways or any germs that reach them. ."

589,"if everyone is running low on facemasks, what else can i use to protect myself from the coronavirus?",they don't . unless you are using high end medical or industrial masks they do not protect you from any such virus. they prevent your cough or expired air from infecting others. any scarf/fabric homemade mask or similar device will do the same. you protect yourself more by washing your hands often & not touching your face/mouth/nose with contaminated fingers.

602,"have read covid-19 news quoting some experts as saying that we will see more confirmed cases as more tests are performed, but the mortality rate should drop as that happens. any sign of that yet?","in brief: covid-19 mortality don't confuse actual mortality rate with reported rate. the actual rate probably will remain stable (and likely lower in the us than some other countries, because of sophisticated intensive medical care). but as testing expands and more people with mild symptoms (or no symptoms) are diagnosed, reported mortality will decline; likely happening now, but it may take weeks for data to be known."

3839,how do i start a conversation with a loved one's dr about simptoms of alzheimer? . how can we get around hippa to get help for our loved ones if they need it?,if you know the doctor's name send a letter or fax with your concerns; mentioning your relationship to this loved one. providing unsolicited information does not violate the law but discussing this information with someone other than the patient is a big no-no. this may help but going with the patient to their doctor's visit would be a way to bring up the subject (with the patient present of course).
678,should my child's cholesterol be checked?,should every child be screened for high cholesterol? that’s an issue currently up for debate. the current recommendations from the american academy of pediatrics say no. as it stands right now there are only certain children who are screened. those include: * children who have a parent or grandparent diagnosed with heart disease at or under 55 years of age. * children who have a parent or grandparent who have had a heart attack heart-related chest pain vascular disease or sudden cardiac death at or under 55 years of age. * children who have a parent with an elevated blood cholesterol level of 240 mg/dl or higher. * children who are diagnosed with obesity. but a recent study questions if practitioners are missing a significant number of children who might be identified with elevated cholesterol levels. having that awareness might encourage families to be stricter about enforcing a healthy diet and exercise routine. and some kids might actually need to be treated with cholesterol-lowering medications. the study found that almost 10 percent of kids who would not be tested under the current guidelines have elevated levels of ldl cholesterol. bottom line: just relying on a family’s history of high cholesterol may be an insufficient screening tool to determine who needs a blood cholesterol level drawn. but even if your child has not been diagnosed with high cholesterol it’s a good idea for everyone to follow the advice of the american heart association — maintain a low-fat diet for all kids ages two and up. and encourage your whole family to take time for exercise every day.
23024,do anxiety and stress negatively affect your cardiovascular system including your cholesterol levels?,while more research is needed to connect stress to a healthy -- or unhealthy -- heart an indirect connection makes this statement a fact: the more stressed out you are the more likely you are to overeat and choose unhealthy foods. both can raise cholesterol levels.

1289,can a women get pregnant after ovulation and while she is having her period?,"it depends how long after actual ovulation. if one knows the actual date of ovulation conception can occur up to 72 hours after ovulation as sperm can live inside the cervix for up to 72 hours under ideal conditions. an oocyte/egg has at least a 48 hour lifespan after ovulation. as you may know the most likely time to conceive is about 14 days before the start of your next period. so if one had a regular 28 day cycle ovulation is around day 14; a regular 34 day cycle will have an ovulation around day 20. if one has a regular 24 day cycle ovulation can be as early as cycle day 10. the problem arises among women who have periods/bleeds which are not linked to an ovulation. these ""non-ovulatory bleeds"" can occur randomly as the too thick lining of the uterus begins to shed on its own. the woman in this case could have a bleed and then an ovulation anytime thereafter. an even more risky scenario would be the women who mistakes bleeding associated with the release of an egg/oocyte as a period. in that case she could get pregnant from intercourse during her ""supposed period"" because she is actually at a very fertile time. bottom line getting pregnant during a ""real"" period is unlikely--especially if it has been 14 days since ovulation occurred. if [there is a concern] do a reliable pregnancy test about two weeks after the date of intercourse. a urine test should be reliable around the time of [the] expected period. lastly if a woman is really scared about having an unplanned pregnancy the worry can cause her flow to be late. . a urine pregnancy test can help resolve any concerns. yes"
9192,i have rosacea. my skin is too sensitive to use a lot of products. how do i pick ones that won't irritate my skin?,rosacea is a very interesting condition. we sometimes also call it adult acne but it's really two different things. so the thing about rosacea is that you do have some control. there are environmental stimuli that can trigger rosacea. so it's important to know what can turn it on and then we can figure out how to turn it off as well. triggers for rosacea tend to be extremes in temperature. so if you go from a very hot environment to a very cold environment or vice versa that can be an extreme trigger for rosacea. probably the biggest trigger for rosacea is alcohol and it can be any type of alcohol but some people notice it more with red wine. also stress can be a very big trigger for rosacea. so you have to manage your stress. obviously we can't live without stress because life would be no fun at all but you have to be able to moderate your stress so that you can handle it better and so it won't show in your skin. once you have that under control as much as possible then you can look for products that are fragrance free and dye free because anything that irritates your skin can also bring out rosacea. so that will be a great starting point. if that alone doesn't help then you might have to go to prescription type products that can help. i like retinoids for treatment of rosacea but you have to do it very gently. topical metronidazole in a prescription form can also be very helpful and salt-based medicines can be very helpful. one other trigger for rosacea can be spicy foods. then some people have their own personal triggers. some people will say chocolate is a trigger or vinegar or some vegetables. so you have to sort of know your own personal triggers as well and try to avoid them. hello you did not say if you we're a man or woman but i have rosacea and i have found that murad products have helped me a great deal. i rarely ever have a breakout now unless i am in the sun a lot. the murad that i use is essential-c day moisturizer broad spectrum spf30/pa +++ orange lettering. second i use murad invisiblur perfecting shield broad spectrum spf 30 pa +++ this is purple lettering. i do not need any of the other products so i do not use them as they are very expensive. also after using the inviiblur perfecting shield i found that i no longer need any makeup or powder on my face other then lipstick and eye liner. good luck.

1495,why doesn't my high hdl cholesterol number necessarily mean i'm in great shape?,i hear every single day from family friends and other doctors that they are in great shape because their hdl cholesterol (the good cholesterol) is high and that is the most important number to look at in a lipid panel. well guess what everyone? unfortunately many of you are quite wrong and i will explain why. we know that low hdl cholesterol (good cholesterol) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. it is included in the most well-known risk factor scoring system for cardiovascular disease called the framingham scoring. surprisingly there is little clinical evidence that therapies directed at raising hdl cholesterol reduce risk. i will say that again there is little evidence that raising one’s good cholesterol number protects them from having a heart attack a stroke or dying. for this reason the national cholesterol education panel (ncep) does not specify a number that would be the “optimal” hdl level of therapy. ncep also states that raising one’s hdl is not a primary or secondary goal of therapy in order to reduce cardiovascular events or death. ncep atp-iii statements about low hdl cholesterol were published in the journal circulation in 2002. here is a selection of facts from the article: * a categorical low hdl-c should be defined as a level of less than 40 mg/dl in both men and women. * whether raising hdl per se will reduce risk for chd has not been resolved. (still true in 2010. ) * some persons with severe deficiency of hdl do not manifest premature coronary heart disease; this suggests that hdl is not uniquely involved in atherogenesis (clogging of the arteries) as is ldl cholesterol (the bad cholesterol). * a specific hdl cholesterol goal level to reach with hdl raising therapy is not identified. in summary when we measure hdl cholesterol we are just measuring a number that tells us nothing about how well it functions. there is no way yet to measure how well one’s hdl functions and thus if one’s level is within normal limits does the person with a higher hdl number have fewer events than a person with lower hdl number? this has never shown to be true in any randomized prospective human studies. this is also defined in scientific terms as no level 1 evidence. there is only data in retrospective and epidemiological studies that show that the higher the hdl cholesterol number the lower the cardiovascular event rate. i will put another twist in the hdl discussion. there is a level at which the hdl cholesterol in some people may be too high and dysfunctional and actually be harmful to the arteries. there is another group of people whose hdl is called apoa1 milano who are all originally from limone italy and have very low levels of hdl cholesterol. approximately 3. 5 percent of these people have hdl levels below 10mg/dl and have virtually no evidence of cardiovascular disease whatsoever. this is a kind of “super hdl. ” the bottom line is that in most people low hdl cholesterol is bad and is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease but a high level may not be protective. the name of the game is to get the ldl cholesterol (the bad cholesterol) down. if anybody is really curious about this point they can take a look at the heart and estrogen replacement study. in this study 20 percent of the women who had heart attacks had hdl cholesterol levels in the 60-80 mg/dl range which is well above normal.
6167,chances of being pregnant after having unprotected sex within the 10th-12th week of being on the depo shot? . i first started getting the depo shot august of last year. i received a shot on september 5th. within the 10th and 12th week on that shot i had unprotected sex multiple times. then i received the shot on november 28th. recently i have been very tired all of the time. i've been sleeping half of my day awake. yesterday i woke up with a sharp pain in my lower abdomen that went away after a few minutes but felt severe. i know there have been many women pregnant on the depo before.,it is not possible to offer you a number -- your statistical chances of becoming pregnant. there are just too many unknown factors to consider. i can say that the depo provera is an excellent contraceptive but not 100%. when you have unprotected intercourse you are really taking a chance with just about any contraceptive method short of sterilization (tubal ligation). could you be pregnant? yes that would be possible. you would need to see your medical provider and have a very accurate pregnancy test ordered or take a few home pregnancy tests. there can be many reasons for a woman to have sharp lower abdominal pain other than a pregnancy so you would benefit from having a hands-on examination. this is really the only way to get a sure answer. hi google depo shot side effects and when you've gone wow or some other degrading word you may come off it it can give some women some very bad side effects. put it this way i would not let my daughter go on it. good luck
16411,medication has helped my anxiety and depression. why do i occasionally have anxiety symptoms nausea and muscle aches?,you can have up and down days and i think it's a question of your body really getting adjusted to the med and how it has to work. it's really a biological reaction and sometimes the body isn't ready to be totally adjusted. the side effects you mention are found with meds but you should tell your doc about these too.

9255,i am 51 years old and considering some facial treatments. what is the difference between microdermabrasion and peels?,the place to start is with proper skin care and this means sun protection every day all year round. after that i recommend using products that contain retinoids. you should also have your dermatologist evaluate your skin to better guide you as to whether or not microdermabrasion chemical peels or laser peels would be best for you. microdermabrasion is a superficial treatment that may help fine lines and wrinkles when used with the right skin care products. there are many different types of chemical peels available some are superficial and others can go to deeper layers of the skin. they should be done by your aesthetic/cosmetic dermatologist in order to have the best results and minimize risks.
21492,how much a 20yr old girl who is 4'9 88. 5 pds is normal or under weight? could she get pregnant at this weight n height? . she always weight the average weights of 88. 5 to 99 pounds her whole life is the normal could this be the reason she havent had a baby yet.,i don't know how long this person has been trying to conceive but if it has been a year or more of unprotected intercourse attempting to become pregnant it is time for her and her partner to seek the help of a fertility specialist. there are dozens of reasons for a couple's failure to conceive. size and height may not be playing an important role but general nutrition can be. if she is not eating properly or losing weight this can certainly affect fertility.
23306,does trichomoniasis cause problems during pregnancy?,yes. trichomoniasis can cause babies to be born early or at a low birth weight (less than 5 pounds). the cdc recommends that women with trichomoniasis who have symptoms should be treated but women without symptoms do not need to be treated. during the first three months of pregnancy many experts feel that women shouldn't take metronidazole (flagyl) because it may hurt the baby. however most doctors feel that metronidazole can be given safely after the end of the first trimester.

11658,can massage help relieve nerve pain from shingles? . my sister has had nerve pain for 10 months now. three doctors say she has the shingles virus and 1 said no but with no other answer. she is 41 and is to young for the shingles vaccine. i am trying to think of ways to help her in relieving the never ending nerve pain. i thought of massage and wondered if that would help. second question: if there are no blisters would she be safe to have a massage or would she put the massage therapist at risk? .,i don't believe that massage will end her nerve pain but it can help relax her a bit. a massage works better to help muscle pain. a medication can be prescribed to help with the nerve pain by making the nerve endings less sensitive. cymbalta is one of the medications that works well. if your sister does not have open sores then she can't pass it to the therapist.
7574,is it safe to take acai berry supplements with accupril metoprolol tartrate cardizem cd lipitor plavix and aspirin?,i'd have to say that's a pretty long list and as a pharmacist i am a little concerned about the fact that they're asking about acai berry. if you have a cardiovascular condition and especially this particular patient has some things going on with their blood pressure i want to find out if maybe they had a previous heart attack or a stroke. because they're on plavix i really would not recommend taking any type of vitamin or herbal supplement. many patients today think that well it's herbal and it has to safe because it's a natural product. we don't have that data. we don't know and every time i see patients who have medication list like this i say them it's not worth risking a trip to the emergency room for something that you wanted to try. so if they have any questions about this particular product or any other product. come and talk to the pharmacist or the medication experts we will probably going to tell you that we don't have a lot of data on this and in this case it's better to be safe than sorry.

"" she may be suffering from bowel incontinence and is embarrassed to discuss it. it concerns me also that you believe this behavior started after she attended basketball camp. bowel incontinence especially in a 12-year-old could be a sign of emotional trauma. i suggest you take your daughter to her primary care provider for an examination. children her age often will talk to a nurse or doctor about issues they won't discuss with their parents. be sure to tell the health care provider about the issue in private and then give your child some time alone with the provider so she feels she can safely discuss anything that might be on her mind. whatever you do don't punish or shame your child over this. your daughter is not doing this ""on purpose"" to make you angry irritate you or anything else. there definitely is an underlying issue here that needs to be addressed. please approach this problem in a sensitive and tactful manner. also if you put your daughter on miralax for constipation and never took her off it she may now have a diarrhea problem. the best solution for constipation is to eat a fiber-rich diet and drink plenty of water. medications or other treatments for constipation should be used only for acute episodes and for a very short period of time. wishing you and your daughter well!"

23305,what happens to someone when they get rh sensitization during pregnancy?,if you are rh-negative unless you are given rh immune globulin just before or after a high-risk event such as miscarriage amniocentesis abortion ectopic pregnancy or childbirth you have a chance of becoming sensitized to an rh-positive fetus 's blood. if you have been rh-sensitized in the past if you have been rh-sensitized in the past you must be closely monitored during any pregnancy with an rh-positive partner because your fetus is more likely to have rh-positive blood. in response to an rh-positive fetus your immune system may quickly develop igg antibodies which can cross the placenta and destroy fetal red blood cells. each subsequent pregnancy with an rh-positive fetus may produce more serious problems for the fetus. the resulting fetal disease (called rh disease hemolytic disease of the newborn or erythroblastosis fetalis) can be mild to severe. mild rh disease involves limited destruction of fetal red blood cells possibly resulting in mild fetal anemia. the fetus can usually be carried to term and requires no special treatment but may have problems with jaundice after birth. mild rh disease is more likely to develop in the first pregnancy after sensitization has occurred. moderate rh disease involves the destruction of larger numbers of fetal red blood cells. the fetus may develop an enlarged liver and may become moderately anemic. the fetus may need to be delivered before term and may require a blood transfusion before (while in the uterus) or after birth. a newborn with moderate rh disease is watched closely for jaundice. severe rh disease ( fetal hydrops ) involves widespread destruction of fetal red blood cells. the fetus develops severe anemia liver and spleen enlargement increased bilirubin levels and fluid retention ( edema ). the fetus may need one or more blood transfusions before birth. a fetus with severe rh disease who survives the pregnancy may need a blood exchange. this procedure replaces most of the infant's blood with donor blood (usually type o rh-negative). a history of pregnancy with rh disease is a sign that you will need special treatment when you are pregnant with an rh-positive fetus. if you have been rh-sensitized in the past an rh-negative fetus cannot trigger an immune reaction. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

5057,i am 35 year working women. feel very tried so should i take vitamin b supplements. or something else. hi. to give me the extra energy somebody said to take vitamin b suplliments. how about taking multi vitamin. will that help me. please suggest me what nutritional suplliments help me to give me the energy and take away my feeling weak. . thanks. jo,"i hate to break the news to you but vitamin b will not create ""extra energy"" in someone who is not vitamin b deficient (like pernicious anemia). the body stores very little nutrients from mulitple vitamins and will eliminate them if not needed. most vitamins and minerals are obtained from our diet. it is okay to take a multi-vitamin if your diet is not very good. any person who is ""weak"" or tired should be carefully examined by their medical provider to find out why. just taking vitamins may not solve this problem."
20736,what pills can reduce stomach fat and consistant bloating. a vegetarian and gluten free but still retain stomach fat and bloating i exercise regularly and drink plenty of water. looking for help.,part of your bloating could be caused by your protein sources. beans and other legumes can cause that so can broccoli soy plenty of vegetables. they can be good for you but you might need some probiotic help or maybe some digestive enzymes. stomach fat won't leave just because you are vegetarian. you still have to exercise regularly (like you are doing) get enough protein to be healthy limit your sugars and starches and take in fewer calories than you burn. you might want to try a different form of exercise to help kick start your fat loss too. if you increase the intensity in what you already do interval fashion you might shock your body a bit and get it working harder. bodies are famous for getting used to an exercise and burning less calories while doing it.

14469,what conditions does cold treat?,this combination medication is used to temporarily treat symptoms caused by the common cold flu allergies or other breathing illnesses (such as sinusitis bronchitis). decongestants help relieve stuffy nose sinus and ear congestion symptoms. acetaminophen (apap) is a non-aspirin pain reliever and fever reducer. antihistamines help relieve watery eyes itchy eyes/nose/throat runny nose and sneezing. cough-and-cold products have not been shown to be safe or effective in children younger than 6 years. therefore do not use this product to treat cold symptoms in children younger than 6 years unless specifically directed by the doctor. some products (such as long-acting tablets/capsules) are not recommended for use in children younger than 12 years. ask your doctor or pharmacist for more details about using your product safely. these products do not cure or shorten the length of the common cold and may cause serious side effects. to decrease the risk for serious side effects carefully follow all dosage directions. do not use this product to make a child sleepy. do not give other cough-and-cold medication that might contain the same or similar ingredients (see also drug interactions section). ask the doctor or pharmacist about other ways to relieve cough and cold symptoms (such as drinking enough fluids using a humidifier or saline nose drops/spray).

7365,what is your opinion of thermage?,well thermage is indeed an fda approved procedure that super heats the skin and specifically the collagen which is one of the main building blocks of skin and theoretically would form new younger and tighter collagen. now that process doesn’t take place over night. and so the manufacturer has advised physicians and secondarily patients that they will not see an immediate result. the hoped for result may take 4 or 5 or 6 months to achieve. that process is probably not achieved the success that we had hoped it might. again by observation because the patients have to accept that when they are employing a new technology. we are all learning about it so the first kid on the block may be satisfied and may be disappointed. i think to this point we’re a little bit disappointed. now that said there haven’t been any complications. i think most patients consider the significant complication to have hit their wallet because they didn’t get much for their money. and it’s not inexpensive. it can be several thousand dollars because it means a visit in the operating room the doctor’s time the technical the cost of the technology. so again not harmful but not really delivering the goods. certainly not a substitute for a surgical facelift. and many services technologies kind of position themselves as less invasive less traumatic less expensive less everything quote facelift but the answer is they can’t match the proven record of a surgical procedure. it’s just not possible by having the skin treated by a beam of light to get rid of a saggy chin and jowls and the product of many years of ages and perhaps even some dissipation.

6151,can i sit in a sauna and steam room with a broken ankle?,not if you are in a cast. it would become so stinky that you could not stand the smell and the humidity has the potential of fostering a very itchy and irritating fungal infection. if you do not have any medical issues that would preclude you from using a sauna or steam room and you are in a boot instead of a cast hobble or hop in carefully (don't slip or fall) consider leaving the boot outside the room and enjoy. there are no reasons a person with a broken ankle cannot have a sauna or steam.
8874,is oxycontin 30mg the same as oxycodone 30 mg? i thought oxycodone was the generic form of the drug. is it?,oxycodone is a narcotic pain reliever. oxycontin is the brand name of a time-release version of oxycodone. so you're correct in that the active ingredient of both products are the same. however plain oxycodone is not a time-release product. the purpose of prescribing the time-release version of a narcotic pain reliever is to allow for longer-lasting pain relief. oxycontin (for which there currently is no generic equivalent in the u. s. ) delivers oxycodone slowly over a period of time. this is why the dosing instructions are very different between oxycontin and regular oxycodone. if you've been prescribed oxycontin you should follow the instructions on the label very carefully. oxycontin is not taken as frequently as plain oxycodone. and obviously do not take both regular oxycodone and oxycontin at the same time as this could lead to an overdose. if you have any questions about any of your prescription medications you can always call your pharmacist. he or she can clarify what a medication is for and how to take it. best to you! order / buy 100% safe pain relief pills medical marijuana cbd oils dabs numbutal more. for more info text (505) 807-7504 lisanblakeretailshop@gmail. com medical marijuana is good for your health top medical strains for all patients suffering from depression glaucoma anxiety and tension headaches chronic pain and nausea mental and physical fatigue and for calming aromatherapy then you are in the right place to look in our meds all top grade aa+ with high level of cbd and thc contact for your supply and good health. pain killers medical marijuana act. lean ***(( no prescribtion is needed))) bud seeds harsh oils dabs & other m. m treatments. we also sefely and securely deliver all sorts of generic medication and syrup nationwide at very good prices. no prescribtions needed. legit verified and reputed plug. available in the u. s canada australia and the uk and more. for more info text (505) 807-7504 lisanblakeretailshop@gmail. com. thank you.

8199,"what is a superior labral tear? . an mri showed a tear in my superior labral. located in my shoulder. along with that tendonitis was diagnosed. what can i do? ice really doesn't help. the pain threshold can be very bad when my arm is lifted a certain way but otherwise it feels perfectly normal. will the tear become worse? will it ""mend"" on its own? i have had two bad bouts with it. maybe overuse? thank you boni","i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it is indeed very painful. in plain english a superior labral tear is a torn tendon at the top of your shoulder joint where the head of your arm bone meets the ""socket"" of your shoulder. it is not an uncommon problem. eventually the tendon probably will heal on its own. tendons and ligaments tend to heal very slowly because they have poor blood supplies. the bad news is it literally can take months for these tears to heal. in the meantime you want to make sure you don't lose range of motion in your shoulder. you should consult your doctor for specific advice on whether or not you should be doing range-of-motion exercises or not. if possible avoid moving your shoulder in a way that causes pain. basically that movement is aggravating the tear which will make it heal more slowly. ice won't help because the soothing comfort of cold can't reach deeply enough into the shoulder joint. if you're not allergic to ibuprofen you can take that for pain. again sorry you're going through this. wishing you well!"
13376,50yrs old had a stroke recovered from it quit smoking. my stomach has doubled in size and its hard to breathe not fat. i smoked for 40yrs then suffered a stroke. i fully recovered from it and havent smoked since that time. its been a year and my stomach has doubled in size not from fat. it is hard like bloated and the rest of my body is fine. im 50yrs old and am very active but i get short on breath sometimes just for no reason! is it possible i have emphezima? i felt fine and had no symptems like this before the stroke! please help with answers. thank you.,congratulations on your stoke recovery and smoking cessation. i smoked 2 1/2 packs of cigarettes per day and made a conscious decision to stop before overt signs of lung or heart disease surfaced. i read that a person who stops smoking at the age of 50 adds six years to their life expectancy. people who quit smoking after having a heart attack reduce their chances of having another heart attack by 50%. but with a history of smoking for 40 years lung and heart disease can still materialize even after years of abstinence. for example i stopped smoking almost 30 years ago and thought that i was out of woods only to have been recently diagnosed with c. o. p. d. (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and a right-sided heart block. the great news is that you will have decreased by 50% after 10 years of non-smoking your chances of succumbing to cancer of the mouth throat esophagus bladder cervix and pancreas. yes it is possible that you have emphysema. please make an appointment to be evaluated by your personal physician. chances are that he or she will request chest x-rays blood work an e. k. g. and other studies. they may also refer you to a cardiologist pulmonologist gastroenterologist and other medical specialist for consultation. you've come so far and deserve an opportunity to lead a productive life. after all you're only 50 years old and should have many good years in the future. please do not dismiss the shortness of breath and changes in the anatomical look of your stomach accompanied with distress. call your doctor without delay.
21161,i live in connecticut and i want to get pregnant but i am on a private insurance plan that wont cover it. any ideas? . i do not qualify for low income health insurance and can't afford the $600 a month to be on my husbands plan. i really don't want to wait till 2014 for the health care reform to kick in. please tell me there is an insurance company out there that will cover me!,if you buy an insurance plan on the private market today you'll spend extra for maternity coverage as you found out. most plans on the private market do not include maternity so gaining that coverage requires that you buy a rider to the plan. your options i'm afraid are to either pay the higher price or purchase a plan through your state's marketplace (start shopping october 1 2013) for a plan that will take effect january 1 2014. all plans sold through the marketplaces must cover maternity care.

10561,can i self-administer systematic desensitization to treat a phobia or does it have to be under the care of a therapist?,hmmm. well the concept is to gradually expose oneself to the stimulus that provokes anxiety and exinguish the fear response by graded exposure. i suppose if someone knows what they are doing then there's no reason they couldn't apply the principle on their own as they saw fit. depending on what the fear was one would want some grasp of knowing how much exposure is too much and what to do if the technique didn't work.

5374,is it a mandatory reuqirement to wear a gown during a physical checkup can i refuse to wear one.,"most helpful answer you can choose to be naked without a gown but in order to do a through examination including looking at your skin for cancerous lesions etc. clothing can be a real barrier. talk to your medical provider. rather than ""refuse"" and make a big deal about it explain your reasons (like shyness) and ask that your medical provider accommodate your wishes. as a rule i allow my patients to keep on most of their clothes (for modesty) and only have the remove the pieces that i need as the exam progresses. exams on males are different that exams on females so i cannot address your specific concerns without knowing your sex. many people insist on the gown feeling they will not a get a thorough exam without getting near-naked; others prefer to have most of their clothes on. i find it very disturbing if my patient is stark-naked while i am trying to take a patient history so even your medical provider prefers some sort of modest attire."

18870,what causes food allergies?,a true allergic reaction to a food is produced by a mistaken immune response. these are called ige-mediated allergies because they are triggered when immunoglobulin e antibodies are produced in response to a specific food the child is sensitive to. there are also other food sensitivities and reactions that are not ige-mediated. for example some young children have a condition called enterocolitis an intestinal inflammation. in these cases they have gastrointestinal symptoms after ingesting milk or soy formula but no respiratory or skin symptoms. these are not ige-mediated allergies and kids usually outgrow this condition by age 2 or 3.

6660,when is a headache a real problem?,many years ago i volunteered to perform sports physicals at four local middle schools. i spent a lot of time in that nurse’s office and apparently so did many of the students. all day long it was a dance of complaints. since the nurse’s professional hands are often tied when it comes to treatment the most common disposition for a sick child is a trip home. next to tummy aches headaches were at the top of the whine list. when i think back to my own middle school days there were plenty of things that can lead to headaches. just being at school all day is a headache to some kids. fortunately for all of us most headaches are not brain tumors or aneurysms. in healthy active kids the most common type of headache that is seen is the classic muscle-tension headache. the brain itself does not feel pain but all of the sensitive nerves muscles and blood vessels of our head can certainly generate a doozie of a headache. don’t get me wrong; headaches can be hallmarks of something more serious but most of the time a random self-limiting headache is just that… a headache. headaches are in the body of the beholder. a medical provider cannot see a headache which makes this an ideal get-out-of-school reason. teenagers tend to be great actors and are able to give a command performance at will. some performances are so good they end up in my office. by the time i see them parents are worried about brain tumors meningitis and all types of horrible diagnoses. “on a one to 10 scale with 10 being the worst headache what number do you give your headache? ” if a comfortable-looking person tells me “nine ” and their mannerism looks more like a one or two i am suspicious. i will then inquire as to the frequency of headaches their location on the head factors that may bring on the headache and things the person does to make the headache better. the number of missed days from school is another important bit of information. “i think it’s a migraine. ” most people don’t have a clue what “migraine” really means but will frequently self-diagnose. most feel that the word “migraine” just indicates a bad headache. when i explain to them that a migraine is a certain type of vascular (blood vessel) headache that usually occurs on just one side of the head usually severe accompanied by nausea/vomiting and proceeded by an “aura” (a feeling that a headache is imminent such as blurry/wavy vision) they will usually admit they do not have these things. migraines tend to run in families and in women may be cyclic related to menstruation. among many other triggers hormonal contraceptives can also trigger migraines in some people. younger children do a lot behavioral modeling. they see a parent constantly complaining of headaches and they may get one too. headaches located at the back of the neck or upper shoulders radiating to the scalp and feeling like your head is in a vise are usually muscle tension headaches. these can be due to sleeping on several thick pillows (flexing the neck) or sitting like a slug in those uncomfortable school desks. nervous tension like algebra tests or the day they need to run a mile in physical education all can create tension headaches. on examination i can usually find a very sore area (trigger point) around the nape of the neck and of course no clinical findings suggestive of brain tumors. parents are relieved; students not so much. sorting out real headaches from just headache complaints used to avoid something requires a lot of skill and experience. kids will get headaches when they are worried. tension at home like parents arguing or families going through a divorce will trigger headaches in kids. a physically or emotionally abusive parent will trigger headaches. bullying at school is another factor. when children are being teased or intimidated by other classmates they may use headaches as an excuse to go home. teachers can be bullies too. when i recall my elementary and middle school days there were some very unfriendly teachers in my life. teachers should always be respected but never feared. in dissecting factors that may be triggering a headache overly demanding (mean) teachers are often high on that list. rather than just prescribe tylenol or motrin it behooves the clinician and the parent to get more information. real headaches exist. serious headaches exist. even those pseudo-headaches deserve our utmost attention.
22917,what are the symptoms of false pregnancy?,women with pseudocyesis have many of the same symptoms as those who are actually pregnant including: stopping of menstrual period. swollen belly. enlarged and tender breasts changes in the nipples and possibly milk production. feeling of fetal movements. nausea and vomiting. weight gain. these symptoms can last for just a few weeks for nine months or even for several years. a very small percentage of patients with false pregnancy will arrive at the doctor's office or hospital with what feels like labor pains but they will not deliver a baby.

11756,how is shingles contagious. when i saw my doctor about a small bump on my arm she said i had the shingles virus. i did not have a rash anywhere on my body. i never had chicken pox but did have measles as a child. i searched the web for an answer but they were confusing. one person said that shingles is contagious and another says that its not. i got a blood test and she said i had the virus. my question is if it is contagious how was it transmitted to me. she said i was exposed who had chicken pox when i was child. help.,20 years ago my husband and i both got shingles at the same time i was 36 and he was 56. we had just moved out of an apartment complex where there was at least 10 cases of chicken pox with the little kids. i had chicken pox as a child but my husband said he did not. when we asked the dr. he said it is not contagious that when my husband was little he probably had a minor case and no one knew. i asked how that could happen. my doc says when one person gets chicken pox the next person to get can be so minor they only get 1 or 2 chicken pox and go on never knowing they had it or the virus
2422,i was told to give my 15 year old daughter barley greens for low iron but can not find anything about iron in it? . my chiropractor said barley green for her to bring up iron levels but i cant find anything that says barley greens is good for this?,"your medical provider should be addressing any low-iron levels experienced by your teenage daughter. the extent and type of treatment will depend on her hemoglobin levels type of anemia etc. in my opinion managing low-iron levels is not in the scope of chiropractic practice. there are many many more iron-rich foods other than ""barley greens"" (if you can even find them) so i think you need a medical perspective first. how does the chiropractor even know she has low iron levels? did she have an anemia blood work-up? the chiropractor knew she had low iron because our kaiser doctor had tested her in september and again in february we tried bringing the iron level up with certain foods but just couldn't do it so the chiropractor suggested that another client of his tried barley greens and it helped her so i'm just trying to figure out the best way to get a 15-year-old girl's up? i hear there are iron tablets but they constipate you and there's different types just can't get a solid answer out of anyone?"
5588,both my sisters kids have severe eczema. im trying for a baby & want to know if eczema can be prevented. both my sisters kids have severe eczema. (2 nieces (aged 8 & 4) & 1 nephew (aged 11)). i'm trying for a baby & want to know if there is anything that can be done to prevent the baby that is going to be conceived from getting eczema or if there some way to make it milder.,eczema tends to be genetically-linked so if you have eczema and your baby's father has eczema there is a very good chance that any of your children will have this dry skin condition. can it be prevented? not really but there are claims out there (still unproven) that probiotics in infant formulas may be helpful. breast feeding is still better. it is really impossible to change your genetics (at least now) so just plan your family and don't stress out over the possibility of having a child with eczema. if it happens you and your husband can deal with it.

18076,hepatitis in a 7 year old girl. pooping and peeing blood went in to the hospital and they have been performing various tests to see what is the issue and where is it coming from. after several blood tests and mri scanning they have found that her liver is inflamed (hepatitis hepatomegaly) and her blood liver count is quite high. they also found something next to her liver but yet can't seem to pin point the problem exactly. the doctor wants to pass on her imagining to a surgeon to get further input and opinions. advice?,i am sorry for your daughter's illness. i know that it is a scary time for you and your family. the waiting period is the worst and should end soon. it sounds like she may have hepatitis a. hepatitis a is primarily contracted by eating or drinking contaminated food or beverages containing the hepatitis a virus. the news is essentially positive in that treatment usually consists of 3 months or so of bed rest with most people making a full recovery within 6 months. it also seems that the doctors are appropriately covering all bases by asking a surgeon to review the mri results. yes the viewing of some undistinguishable object next to the liver is worrisome but it could end up being a benign and non-issue. at this time it is difficult not knowing the complete results of the mri for your precious daughter. based upon her young age having a supportive mother and doctors that are investigating all possibilities i'm rooting for and predicting a positive outcome.

8884,what are these strange lines on my left shin? started appearing about 9 months ago and are not scars or pressure marks. there are 8 indented lines on my left shin that started appearing about 9 months ago. sometimes they are not visible but when they are they are always exactly the same. i have never injured my leg so they are not scars and they are definitely not pressure marks from socks or pants. they are about 1 inch long and run perfectly parallel with each other.,that is kind of weird isn't it? unfortunately only a physical examination can help figure out what those marks are. from your description they almost sound like stretch marks but the shin would be a very odd place to find stretch marks. i'd suggest you make an appointment with your primary care provider to get them looked at. i don't think they're the hallmark of anything serious but i'm not a doctor. a physician nurse practitioner or physician assistant might see these marks as a sign of some other condition. that's why i'm suggesting you see a doctor. this isn't an emergency situation but it's worth getting checked out. i realize this answer is unsatisfying but i hope you find it helpful!

22036,as a teen how can exercise affect my weight?,because exercise helps use up oxygen it causes your body to burn stored fat and helps you maintain a normal weight. for instance if you walk 4 miles a day four times a week you can burn about 1 600 calories or nearly half a pound a week. if you don't change your diet at all and keep walking the same distance over six months you'll lose 12 pounds. walk the same distance for a year and you'll drop 24 pounds! the neat thing about exercise is you don't have to do it all at one time. after all not many teens have time to walk 4 miles after school! but you can do 4 miles in short bursts throughout your day. here's an idea of how to work that much exercise into your daily regimen: take a 1-mile walk on a treadmill before school. then take a 1-mile walk around the track during school lunch period. take a 1-mile walk after school with friends or the family dog. take a 1-mile walk on the treadmill while watching your favorite show before dinner. if you stay with the walking program you'll see benefits with: weight loss muscle strengthening and definition stronger bones a lower heart rate better mood an improved complexion.

17271,does child ibuprofen interact with any other medications?,"drug interactions may change how your medications work or increase your risk for serious side effects. this document does not contain all possible drug interactions. keep a list of all the products you use (including prescription/nonprescription drugs and herbal products) and share it with your doctor and pharmacist. do not start stop or change the dosage of any medicines without your doctor's approval. some products that may interact with this drug include: aliskiren ace inhibitors (such as lisinopril) angiotensin ii receptor blockers (such as valsartan losartan) cidofovir corticosteroids (such as prednisone). this medication may increase the risk of bleeding when taken with other drugs that also may cause bleeding. examples include anti-platelet drugs such as clopidogrel ""blood thinners"" such as dabigatran/enoxaparin/warfarin among others. check all prescription and nonprescription medicine labels carefully since many medications contain pain relievers/fever reducers (including aspirin nsaids such as celecoxib ketorolac or naproxen). these drugs are similar to ibuprofen and may increase your risk of side effects if taken together. however if your doctor has directed you to take low-dose aspirin for heart attack or stroke prevention (usually at dosages of 81-325 milligrams a day) you should continue taking the aspirin unless your doctor instructs you otherwise. daily use of ibuprofen may decrease aspirin's ability to prevent heart attack/stroke. talk to your doctor about using a different medication (such as acetaminophen) to treat pain/fever. if you must take ibuprofen talk to your doctor about possibly taking immediate-release aspirin (not enteric-coated/ec) while taking ibuprofen. take ibuprofen at least 8 hours before or at least 30 minutes after your aspirin dose. do not increase your daily dose of aspirin or change the way you take aspirin/other medications without your doctor's approval."
17755,what should i eat and drink if i've had an incident of high blood pressure for the first time? . yesterday i had 8 moles removed. after the surgery i got a big headache. i was placed under observation for about an hour and given paracetamol until my blood pressure dropped. first time anything like this has ever happened to me. i still have a bit of a residual headache. could this have been caused by the anesthesia used? . can i eat normally have a glass of wine etc? should i take it easy for a day or two or can i go for walks and such?,avoid foods with high fat and salt content and avoid the wine just for now. foods high in potassium can counteract sodium since both work together in the body. foods such as banana's potatoes dark leafy greens and some yoghurts contain potassium. increase your fibre and magnesium intake which are again found in the food mentioned above as well as various other food like spinach tuna tomatoes kale apples oranges etc. again remember everything needs to be in moderation. eating 15 oranges or bananas is just going to cause other problems. i myself (and i am not an expert) would do light exercise such as walking as exercise is great in reducing blood pressure. however your body is a great judge on what is and is not best for you. if you feel too ill to go walking then don't! i cannot comment about the potential link with anesthesia used but i would not be too concerned at this current time. your body has just undergo a lot of stress and changes to accommodate for the surgery. your heart may have been pumping harder to keep your body functioning normally during this period of stress. it may take time for your body to adapt to the calm after the storm. i hope this may help reassure you <positive_smiley>

29184,my 1 month old caught the common cold from his older sister. what will the doctors do or give him if i take him to the hospital; being that he is so young?,babies have received the immunity from the mother when they were still in the womb. this protects the baby in the first six months of its life. however this makes the baby susceptible to viruses and bacteria at the same rate as the mother. when you take the baby to a doctor a physical examination of the nose the throat and the lungs would be done. laboratory tests needed to detect the exact cause of the infection are likely to be performed too. since a common cold is usually caused by a virus the doctor might decide not to prescribe antibiotics and instead opt to wait and see. if the baby has a fever antipyretics would be recommended. if a bacterial cause is detected then adequate antibiotics would be given. the only specific thing about this is that not all antibiotics are recommended for babies. but do not worry. a -pediatrician whom you are advised would know what antibiotic is allowed to be given to your baby. a pump to take out the fluid from the nose would ease the babyâs breathing. this would also help the baby to eat because a running nose might make the breastfeeding more difficult because the baby would keep gasping for air.

20244,my last period was nov 8. i took two hpt that were negative. could i still be pregnant? . i drink lots of water and have regular cycles,ok it is possible. but 98% of the time women don't have periods when pregnant but there are rare cases in which they do. so to your question. it could be possible sometimes those hpt tests are 100% true. i took 3 here just recently back. i had 2 positives and 1 negative. and see this was after i had a tubaligation done. so i would highly recommend to go see your pcp because if you haven't had a period since november i would think you would be. but this way they can do a blood test which is more accurate. when i took a test with my daughter it took 30 minutes to read and than it was extremely faint so when i went and had the blood test done it was positive and accurate. hope all turns out for the best for you and i really hope i was some kind of help. good luck.
20739,"how to lose more weight and get into exercise? . so back in march i weighed 150 lbs at 5'7"". i had been rather fed up with this so i cut out a lot of carbs (less bread pasta sugar etc). by may i weighed 140 lbs and now i think its time to lose 10 more pounds. seeing as my diet is a lot healthier i suspect changing that any further won't help unless i go extreme and be miserable. i've tried cardio regimes but the soreness always keeps me from sticking with it. if i am sore is it a good idea to exercise anyway?",go slowly at first if you are sore - weight training might be helpful for you as well. keep in mind that cardio is great for endurance and fat burning but for every pound of muscle you burn 6 calories versus 2 for every pound of fat per day. make sure you eat enough protein and vegetables you were doing great in your carb cutting.

6569,i'm 5'4 26 year old female weighing 180 pounds and i want to lose all excess fat and weight? yet i eat when depressed.,many people over-eat when they are upset depressed or anxious. the easy answer would be for you to see your medical provider so that you can have your depression properly treated first however i know this is not a simple solution. losing weight is not easy. if it was no one would be overweight. it comes down to simple math: you need to eat less than your body needs to maintain your current weight and you need to expend more calories. as little as a 500 calorie reduction per day of what you are eating now could result in a 50 pound weight loss in a year. before starting any weight loss diet it would be best for you to see your medical provider for an examination determine the amount of weight it would be ideal for you to lose and determine the best way for you to achieve this important goal. at the same visit you can address those triggers that make you feel depressed. if need be you can ask for a referral to counselor. anyone can lose weight. all they need to the proper method and the personal motivation. if you need help then some of the commercial weight loss programs like weight watchers can be of great help to you. the group dynamics can be quite motivating.

11090,why does my child always seem to have a cold?,school children are incredibly good at passing a virus along. children naturally exhale more highly concentrated virus droplets than adults do. they also exhale them for longer periods of time. plus children are very active always in each other's faces. and there is a general lack of hygiene -- children don't wash their hands. they don't cover noses or mouths when they sneeze or cough. even more importantly they don't get very sick -- which means they continue to spread the virus while they are very contagious.
6253,my right nostril is stopped up. had 2 treatments of antibiotics. what to do? . went to doctor in october for sinus. left nostril cleared up but right remains stopped up. went back in november received another treatment of antibiotics and mucinex. left nostril is so clear its dry. right nostril is still stopped up and gets worse at night making breathing through my nose impossible. i can't take antihistmines for a long period of time because they eventually trigger my bronchotis(excuse the spelling) and make me feel bad. what do i do? . .,it may be time to see an ent -- ear nose and throat -- specialist; someone who has the skill and equipment to peer up that clogged nostril of yours to see if you have a physical obstruction like a deviated septum or polyp. if not a trial of nasal corticosteroid sprays (by prescription only) may be something for your doctor to try. not all sinus infections (as a matter of fact very few) are due to bacterial infections so this could be another reason why the two course of antibiotics didn't seem to help. the ent can also check your sinuses.

7385,why does a faster surgery produce a better outcome?,all things considered it’s in the patient’s interest that the surgery be done in less time rather than more time because the lack of efficiency that would translate a shorter operation to a longer operation has a consequence of more swelling and more bruising. it is a natural tendency for human tissue when being manipulated for 4 hours to swell more than it would if it were manipulated for 2 hours or say 1 hour. the drugs that we inject at the time of surgery and this is after the patient is asleep which numb the tissue allowing a lighter anesthetic by the anesthesia specialist also contains that anesthetic drug also contains a drug to shrink the blood vessels to clamp off the blood supply so that we’re not operating in a pool of blood. otherwise we couldn’t do our work we can’t see. but that is not an indefinite period of time. in other words it’s pretty finite. after an hour to an hour and a half that drug wears off the blood vessels start to open up and now they leak more. so ideally you’d like to get that operation done or at least that part of the operation done in less than an hour to an hour and a half. therefore the object generally in nasal surgery which has big potential for significant bleeding get the operation done in less than an hour. whether you’re operating for cosmetic purposes or cosmetic and even breathing purposes you’ve got about one golden hour to do the work. so if you do it less swelling less bruising. now we do have the help of some medications. but they are not always as predictable and they effect different people and bruising is a phenomenon for example that can depend on everything from your natural innate tendency to bruise some people say i’m a bruiser some aren’t to for a woman what point in the menstrual cycle are they. oh yeah. so you’ve got all these factors in play and we haul out all the best drugs we can. in order to reduce the bruising we have the anesthesiologist inject an anti swelling medication even prior to the outset of the operation before we make the first incision so that we know that there’s this big rush of drugs that have now been absorbed into the body and are available to reduce the swelling.
17725,how can a hernia be mistaken for a testicular disease?,hernias are sometimes mistaken for testicular disease. when a lower part of the abdominal wall muscles are weak part of the intestine can bulge through it. when the intestine pushes into the scrotum it's called an inguinal hernia -- although the scrotum swells and it can appear to be a testicular problem. the solution is surgery to fix the weak part of the abdominal wall.

20796,im having trouble conceiving. it seems like were doing everything right but everyone else is getting prego not me help! . we have increased intercourse reduced smoking and caffine intake started exercising its been about 6 months and no hope and i just recently had to have my appendix removed could that be a factor in the trouble were having,on average it takes a normal couple one year to get pregnant. have intercourse every other day not every day (every day reduces sperm counts). and if you want to be more accurate use ovulation test strips. you are most fertile 3 days before you ovulate to 1 day after ovulation. answer test strips are my favorite because they offer 20 strips a month for you to test on (great if you have irregular cycles). the second line on the strip will often be darker than the control line when you do ovulate. keep track of your cycles on a calendar so you know approximately when you ovulate so you can target the days you try to conceive better. if it goes past a year or if your monthly cycles are over 35 days (from the first day of your period to your next first day) you can go to the doctor and get checked out but chances are you just need a little more time! good luck!

15174,how is parkinson's disease diagnosed?,there are currently no blood or laboratory tests that have been proven to help in diagnosing sporadic parkinson's disease. therefore the diagnosis is based on medical history and a neurological examination. the disease can be difficult to diagnose accurately. early signs and symptoms of parkinson's disease may sometimes be dismissed as the effects of normal aging. the physician may need to observe the person for some time until it is apparent that the symptoms are consistently present. doctors may sometimes request brain scans or laboratory tests in order to rule out other diseases. however ct and mri brain scans of people with parkinson's disease usually appear normal. since many other diseases have similar features but require different treatments making a precise diagnosis as soon as possible is essential so that patients can receive the proper treatment.

6501,i have a gouge on the mid-tip of my thumb;a piece the flesh is gone; it keeps bleeding no pain. how do i treat it? . thumb was caught in the metal prongs of a wine opener and pulled the skin off. it does not look like a stich is possible as the laceration is more like a hole. when i remove the bandage it still bleeds and i am unable to put any ointment on the wound. it was done at 35 000 feet in the air; i work as a flight attendant.,"since you message is two hours old now (webmd answers is not an emergency response service! ) i suspect the bleeding has stopped by now. in most cases these avulsion-type cuts will bleed quite freely but steady pressure/compression on the wound (without peeking! ) for at least ten minutes or so should suffice. compression and time will allow these tiny severed blood vessels to close. once the bleeding has stopped you can inspect your wound to see if suturing is requiried. if so you have have an 8 hour or so ""window"" to have this done. if the flap of skin has been completely severed and the wound is small it should heal and new skin will cover the area. if the flap is hanging on and is pink (means it has a viable blood supply) allow this piece to cover the wound and it may re-graft. obviously without seeing it it is difficult to offer you patient-specific advice."

10220,so is there a cure for seborrheic dermatitis? . is there any truth to mayonnaise and vitamin e oil applied to affected areas curing this ailment?,"i'm sorry you're suffering from this condition. thankfully although it's unsightly and sometimes painful it is not life-threatening. there is no cure i'm aware of for seborrheic dermatitis. this condition causes scaly skin patches and flaking. it also can cause pain. you can see a dermatologist for more information and medications to treat seborrheic dermatitis. there are prescription creams that can help calm flare-ups. there is no truth whatsoever to the claim that mayonnaise or vitamin e oil will ""cure"" seborrheic dermatitis. it's possible applying an oil like vitamin e will improve the appearance of scaly patches -- but then again it's possible those patches will clear up on their own without applying anything at all to them. wishing you well!"

19713,my 4 year old was diagnosed with descending testicals. has this already affected his fertility? . my son is 4 and was just diagnosed with descending testicals. what are the chances that he will still be able to have children of his own when he is older if he has surgery to correct his condition now.,i think you mean undescended testicles (ones that are not in the scrotum where they belong but rather in the abdomen). at age four bringing them down now is advisable. it would be highly highly unlikely that future fertility would be adversely impacted since you are doing surgery at this age. i think you will end up with plenty of grandchildren.
8858,food poisoning? consumed 9 day old sliced corned beef (deli) had not checked date on previously opened bag. . within 6 hours extreme chills shaking of trunk and arms. no fever. in bed with lots of blankets still could not get warm. after 3 hours diarrhea. . shaking continued for 3 more hours then finally sleep. . . . next day achey sore all muscles in trunk and arms. diarrhea all day. . . . food poisoning? i can't find where chills are mentioned. thank you.,most helpful answer sorry to hear you went through that. it sounds awful! this definitely could have been a case of food poisoning. many packaged meats (including those from a deli) contain quite a few preservatives but the meat still could have gone bad after nine days. abdominal cramps diarrhea nausea chills fever headache and weakness all can be signs of food poisoning. the exact symptoms relate to the type of germ causing the food poisoning. also symptoms from the most common types of food poisoning usually start within 2 to 6 hours of consuming the contaminated food so your symtpoms match up with that timeframe. except for infants children the elderly pregnant women or those with compromised immune systems most people don't require treatment for food poisoning. it should go away on its own within a couple of days. the best thing to do is drink plenty of water and allow the diarrhea to flow. you want to let those bad germs get out of your body. if the diarrhea continues for more than three days it may be time to try an over-the-counter anti-diarrhea medication or consult a health care provider. i hope you're feeling better by now! you probably won't want any corned beef for awhile.
14861,i am 74 years old and underwent brachytherapy for my prostate cancer. how will i know when the prostate cancer is gone?,"as far as when the cancer is gone it may take 18-24 months for the radiation to clear the cancer from your prostate gland. the psa should go down to a very low number. the best results are when the psa goes to less than 0. 2ng/ml. certainly if the psa does not fall to below 0. 5ng/ml by 2 years this may mean the brachytherapy did not work completely. if your psa does not drop to these low levels you may need another prostate biopsy but this should not generally be done until after 18-24 months. there is also something called ""psa bounce"" where the psa can temporarily bump up after brachytherapy. this is important because if this happens in the first 2 years you should not worry about cancer returning right away and wait out the psa bounce and usually it falls back down. in general. brachytherapy is a good choice for men in their 70's. ."
12962,what causes right-sided heart failure?,severe copd can cause heart failure in the heart’s right ventricle a condition called right-sided heart failure or cor pulmonale. in severe copd oxygen concentration in the blood falls to abnormally low levels. in response the walls of the main blood vessels inside the lungs (pulmonary arteries) experience changes. the blood pressure inside these arteries goes up as well. this is one type of a condition called pulmonary hypertension. the heart’s right ventricle pumps blood through the pulmonary arteries into the lungs. high blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries puts excess strain on the right ventricle. over time the right ventricle may become stretched and dilated and fail to pump blood effectively. right-sided heart failure causes fluid to accumulate in the body such as in the legs and abdomen. many conditions other than copd also cause pulmonary hypertension and right-sided heart failure.

21849,if a woman had her tubes tied 13 years ago can she still get pregnant now. i havent had a period in four months.,"tubal ligation is considered a permanent form of birth control. it's highly doubtful you could get pregnant 13 years after having your tubes tied. a more likely culprit in your lack of a period would be the onset of menopause. before jumping to that conclusion however you'd be wise to take a home pregnancy test just to be safe. and then you'd be well advised to take a trip to the gynecologist to find out what's going on for sure. if you are in fact in the beginning stage of menopause (called "" perimenopause "") your gynecologist can advise you about what to expect over the next few years. wishing you all the best!"

20211,"i have weakness and tingling and a feeling of lazyness in my right side (arm leg face). along with the ""butterflies"" occurring in my right arm leg and face. my lower right leg is extremely tired and sore all the time. for example i will go on run and my lower right leg will be sore while the left is fine. i've checked out my shoes. i've rested it for days without running and nada. it is almost as if it is really tired and just wants to stop working",this could be caused by several different things one being something going on with your back e. g. bulging or herniated disc.
10207,i am a perimenopausal woman and i have started noticing that my hair is thinning. what can i do to fix this?,thinning hair is a very common problem. it's as common in women as it is in men. but unfortunately for women it's much harder to conceal. and women don't really have the option of going bald and being proud of it the way men do sometimes. so it is important to be able to disguise that. let's start with the underlying causes. there are two types of hair loss that occur in women: scarring and non-scarring. the most common is non-scarring and this tends to be genetic and familial. even if no one in your family had hair loss it can still happen to you and still be part of your genetic makeup. so once you have that issue it's important to be evaluated by a dermatologist or internist or ob/gyn. there are a lot of doctors who can do the evaluations for you. sometimes we check hormonal levels. often even if the hormone tests come back normal there is still somewhat of an hormonal imbalance that may be occurring. people often think that thyroid changes can lead to hair loss but it really doesn't. it may make your hair more dry and brittle but doesn't typically make your hair fall out. but it's worth having your thyroid checked as well to make sure that everything is in order. taking supplements does not really help hair growth. i have a lot of patients who take biotin to help their hair grow. but it doesn't really help if you don't have a biotin deficiency. biotin will make your hair stronger potentially again only if you have a deficiency in that area. there are no other supplements that i know of that have been proven in the literature to help grow hair. however having any nutritional imbalance may have an effect on your hair. another cause of hair loss would be stress. sometimes when you have a stress you can see the hair loss starting about three months later. you have to think about what stress you might have had three to four months before because that's about how long it takes to show. to conceal hair loss you can try combing your hair different changing your hair style or coloring it a little closer to your own natural scalp or skin color. use more neutral tones as opposed to a very dark or light tones. also there are powders that you can add to your hair that work as hair expanders to make your hair appear more full and thick. the one thing you don't want to do is to over tease or over process your hair because then you are pulling it out and causing more damage.
10644,if my mother had bipolar and my cousin has bipolar what are the chances that i will have bipolar? . i have not been feeling like my self lately and i think i have bipolar. i have been so angry i feel as if i have racing thoughts some days i feel as if i an do anything others i feel like the world is crashing down on me. i get so angry sometimes then i am fine in 5 minutes then i am back to being so angry for no reasons. i get so angry i hit walls or lash out at people. other days i am a nice guy and loving i don't understand it will someone please help. thanks,mental illness including bipolar can run in families so there is higher chance that you could be bipolar. i recommend seeing a primary doctor and then he/she can let you know if you need to see a specialist. the symptoms you decribe are similar to someone who has bipolar disorder but they can also be symptoms of other things. since you have family with the disorder you know what symptoms to look for. this can both help and hinder you. help cause you know what to look for and hinder becasue you are quicker to put those symptoms and diagnosis on yourself. seeing a doctor is going to be your best bet! gook luck!

23141,what allergy medications are safe to use during pregnancy?,i always typically refer my pregnant moms to make sure that they talk to their healthcare provider first because they might have a particular brand that they are comfortable with. i always typically refer my pregnant moms to make sure that they talk to their healthcare provider first because they might have a particular brand that they are comfortable with. there is another product out on the market called chlor-trimeton and that’s an older medication very similar to benadryl that is still available and that has great data with it because it was actually tested in pregnancy; and that is considered very safe and effective. zyrtec and claritin are other alternatives that could be used; but once again i do stress though the fact that they should really call their healthcare provider first and see what they prefer as far as the drug to treat with. now if they have a stuffy nose it’s a little different subject because nasal decongestants aren’t as safe in pregnant women and typically they have to use a saline nasal spray which i know is difficult because it may not relieve the congestion as much; but it’s really the safest thing for them to use.

17215,how do i keep track of how much medication is in my metered dose inhaler?,check the side of the canister for the number of puffs it contains. then keep track of how many times you use it each day. this way you can estimate when your metered dose inhaler is likely to run out. put that date right on the canister. be sure to have your prescription refilled one to two days before this date. some mdi's contain a color-coded side window that indicates when the medication is running out. it may be difficult for you to keep track of how much you use your inhaler -- perhaps because you only use it every once in a while as a rescue medication. if so ask your doctor about mdis that count the puffs each time you press the inhaler. or ask about getting two inhalers at a time. when one runs out get a refill so you always have an inhaler handy. throw away the mdi when it is empty even if it continues to spray.

(although several small pieces were swallowed) there were small plastic pieces that were caught in blender. i put nuts in the blender with powder that is very viscous. will it pass thru easily enough? . . . .,after 2 hours the stomach content has likely passed into the small intestine so vomiting would not likely be helpful. assuming these pieces are not unusually sharp those tiny pieces of plastic should pass through harmlessly. in the future it is best not to post urgent questions (since your question had a time constraint) but rather call your medical provider or the local poison control center.

7386,what new procedures are being considered for bags under the eyes?,last week i attended a two-day seminar on plastic surgery at the cedars-sinai medical center here in the beverly hills area. it was excellent. we had terrific speakers from various sub-specialties including facial plastic surgery general plastic surgery ophthalmic plastic surgery and cosmetic dermatology. one of the more interesting subjects was how we surgeons now view the treatment of the aging lower eyelids. because of the stellar performance of filling solutions such as restylane juvaderm perlane sculptra radiesse and artefill we are exploring new roles for these products. the sense now is that we can be more conservative about taking out the extra fatty tissue of the lower eyelids. one reason is that often the fat bag prominence is partly due to shrinkage of the fat over the cheek bones just below the lower eyelid fat bag. so the contrast between the bulging of the fat and the flatness of the adjacent cheek tissue renders the fat more visible and unsatisfactory. consequently many surgeons are evaluating the appearance that follows after merely using filling injections along the lower rim of the orbital bone. in other words the hill doesn’t look so high when you fill the adjacent valley. for many patients that is all they need. some patients will still need a chemical skin peel or laser treatment to help tighten the lower eyelid skin’s fine lines or wrinkles. others have darkness of the skin which is the most difficult problem and our scientific artillery is not yet good enough consistently for that although there are some new bleach creams that seem promising. i enjoy attending these continuing medical education seminars because we collectively are probing and searching — always — for better and safer treatments for patients. such is the history of all medical practice for thousands of years. remember “science never sleeps. ”

7976,i am on a doctor-prescribed liquid diet and am chewing gum between meals. should i brush after every meal instead?,"there are two issues here. let's start with the brushing first. i love the fact that you want to brush after every meal. this is the best way to keep excellent oral hygiene. however if you cannot brush after every meal brushing morning and night is quite sufficient. the best thing is to ask your dentist/hygienist to evaluate your home care and let him/her give you the proper feedback if you are doing it right. the gum issue is different: gum chewing (on the contrary to the trident commercial) is not totally good for you. the good thing is that it stimulates salivation making your mouth ready for food consumption (is that what your really want when you are on a diet? ). the bad thing about gum chewing is that it over-exercises your muscles of mastication. we are not supposed to chew ""non-stop"" throughout the day. when you do that you are putting undue stress on your teeth and muscles and cause premature wear and tear. your teeth should only come into contact when you swallow and if they do otherwise you will experience premature wear of your dentition. keep brushing and flossing regularly and easy on the gum chewing."
23725,i was diagnosed with diabetes shouldn’t my doctor suggest metformin?,hba1c levels above 6. 5% is considered to be diabetes. and you already have 7. diet and lifestyle will definitely help but you should monitor your blood sugar levels by checking your fasting the post prandial blood sugar levels. in case if they are consistently high then it is always better to take oral hypoglycemic drugs like metformin and others under supervision of a diabetologist. so my advice is to check for 15 days regularly and consult a diabetologist. hope this helps.

15774,what are osteoporosis symptoms and signs?,"osteoporosis can be present without any symptoms for decades because osteoporosis doesn't cause symptoms until bone fractures. moreover some osteoporotic fractures may escape detection for years when they do not cause symptoms. therefore patients may not be aware of their osteoporosis until they suffer a painful fracture. the symptom associated with osteoporotic fractures usually is pain; the location of the pain depends on the location of the fracture. the symptoms of osteoporosis in men are similar to the symptoms of osteoporosis in women. fractures of the spine (vertebra) can cause severe ""band-like"" pain that radiates from the back to the sides of the body. over the years repeated spinal fractures can lead to chronic lower back pain as well as loss of height and/or curving of the spine due to collapse of the vertebrae. the collapse gives individuals a hunched-back appearance of the upper back often called a ""dowager hump"" because it commonly is seen in elderly women. a fracture that occurs during the course of normal activity is called a minimal trauma or stress fracture. for example some patients with osteoporosis develop stress fractures of the feet while walking or stepping off a curb. hip fractures typically occur as a result of a fall. with osteoporosis hip fractures can occur as a result of trivial accidents. hip fractures also may heal slowly or poorly after surgical repair because of poor healing of the bone."
22567,how can i figure out my menstural cycle so that i can become pregnant?,most women conceive faster if they understand their menstrual cycle. it's important to note that many women do not have regular cycles. your cycle begins on the first day that you notice bright red blood -- not just spotting -- and it ends on the day before the next cycle begins. the length of a woman's cycle can vary from 21 to 35 days or more. if you notice that the length of your cycle varies by a few days from one month to the next then your cycle is considered irregular.
1435,according to the cdc 16 new antibiotics came to market between 1983-1987 but only 2 between 2003-2007. why so few?,the number of new antibiotics in development is alarmingly low and it's a matter of resources. antibiotics are taken for a shorter period of time and it's more economical for drug companies to make drugs that are taken for a long time. we're also promoting the concept of using these antibiotics judiciously so companies and researchers don't see the economic benefit. antibiotics are not used in volume like a cholesterol or diabetes medication. the fda is currently considering options to facilitate new antibiotic development.
29573,what could be the cause for rise in bp?,a blood pressure of 145/85 mmhg comes under grade 1 (mild) systolic and prehypertensive diastolic blood pressure. nifedipine use should be stopped as soon as possible. nifedipine can cause hypotension and results in severe tachycardia. basically you do not need any medication for blood pressure right now. your problems are because of your higher anxiety levels. i suggest you do 45 minutes of strenuous exercise daily. avoid oily and fast food. take a low salt diet and eat lots of fibers and fruits. drink plenty of water. stop all the antihypertensive medications. for your raised anxiety level i suggest you take tablet clonazepam 0. 25 mg once before sleep for 14 days. please consult your specialist doctor discuss with him or her and take the medication with consent. do not overthink about the blood pressure. food cannot cause this problem especially if you do not have an acid peptic problem or heartburn or peptic ulcers. revert back after 10 days to a cardiologist online --> <link>

8231,can perioral dermatitis spread on make-up brushes?,"this is a good question and you're wise to think in terms of avoiding the spread of any contagious condition. the good news is perioral dermatitis isn't contagious. dermatitis means skin (derm) inflammation (itis). because dermatitis is simply an inflammation of the skin (though it's often accompanied by cracking and flaking) it's not something you spread to someone else. the ""perioral"" part of your diagnosis merely denotes the location of the dermatitis. ""peri"" being ""around "" and ""oral"" being ""the mouth. "" skin inflammation around the mouth. that's all it is. all that said you still may want to keep your makeup brushes to yourself. cracked flaky inflamed skin creates a route for someone else's viruses (like oral herpes) or bacteria to enter your skin. you can't spread your dermatitis to someone else but that doesn't mean someone else couldn't spread an infection to you. wishing you well!"
19477,how do you break a fever in a toddler?,remember that any fever in a newborn infant (under 3 months of age) needs prompt medical attention because at that age it’s hard to tell when a serious infection might be present. a fever is the body’s natural response to infection or other illness and will subside when the underlying process gets better. other than treating the infection (or other condition) causing it no home treatments can shorten the duration of a fever. also remember that fever doesn’t always need to be treated. if a toddler is acting normally and unbothered by her fever and her temperature is less than 104 degrees (40 degrees celsius) there’s no need to treat the fever. for a fever that’s high or is bothering your toddler either acetaminophen (mapap tylenol) or ibuprofen (advil motrin) are good treatments. you’ll need to know your toddler’s weight (don’t guess) and use the dosing guidelines on the package. it’s best to stick with one medicine if you can. if you feel you need to use multiple drugs call your pediatrician’s office. don’t ever use aspirin to treat a child’s fever as it increases the risk for reye’s syndrome. if sponging with water helps your child with a fever feel better use a warm bath (not cool) with water around 85 degrees.

7920,what kinds of foods will boost my immune system?,i can’t count how many people around me are coming down with a winter cold/flu. i’m in the process of trying to boost up my immune system and fight the good fight and not end up in bed for a few days. the odds are stacked against me. half of the people at my restaurant have been sick as well as the kids at my daughters’ school and i’ve been on six flights in the past 10 days. i can feel the colds lurking around and waiting to pounce. i usually remember to amp up my vitamin c intake when this season starts to come around. (i add 1 000 mg of the powdered form to water with fresh lemon juice two to three times a day). there are things we can do to try to up our chances for staying healthy: getting enough rest keeping our hands washed and drinking plenty of water are the top three. the good news is there are many foods in our kitchens that are beneficial to keeping our immune system strong and in fighting condition. at the top of the list are: 100 percent orange juice (preferably fresh squeezed). avocado. tomatoes. bell peppers. broccoli. garlic. grapefruit. lean meat. yogurt or kefir (not one too high in sugar). the great thing is you can use these foods throughout your day: a glass of fresh orange juice and yogurt is a healthy start to the day. you can add avocado tomatoes and turkey to a salad or a sandwich on whole-grain bread for lunch. for dinner i love to make a broth with lots of slivered garlic when i feel a cold coming on. i’ll use already made organic chicken broth and sliver about 3-4 cloves or garlic and add a lot of lime or lemon to the broth. if i have fresh ginger i will grate this into the heating broth as well. finely chopped up broccoli is perfect tossed in at the end. add a couple of cups of baby spinach (to 4 cups of broth) as well or thinly cut up kale or chard. this will give an additional boost of vitamin c. another use for grapefruit is in a salad. you can toss avocado and grapefruit segments with mixed lettuces. add extra virgin olive oil and fresh lemon juice salt and cracked pepper for a healthy delicious salad that will be on your side in a fight against a cold.
22274,how much exercise do older adults need for health and fitness?,"the american college of sports medicine and american heart association published guidelines for physical activity in older adults. here is a summary of the recommendations: aerobic exercise (walking jogging dancing biking swimming etc. ): to promote and maintain health older adults need moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity for a minimum of 30 minutes five days each week or vigorous intensity aerobic activity for a minimum of 20 minutes three days each week. (moderate intensity is when you feel ""warm and slightly out of breath "" and vigorous is when you feel ""out of breath and sweaty. "") resistance exercise (weight lifting calisthenics): to promote and maintain health and physical independence older adults will benefit from performing activities that maintain or increase muscular strength and endurance for a minimum of two days each week. it is recommended that eight to 10 exercises be performed on two or more nonconsecutive days per week using the major muscle groups. flexibility exercise : to maintain the flexibility necessary for regular physical activity and daily life older adults should perform activities that maintain or increase flexibility at least two days each week for at least 10 minutes each day. balance exercise : to reduce risk of injury from falls older adults with substantial risk of falls (for example with frequent falls or mobility problems) should perform exercises that maintain or improve balance."
9467,how is having a $3000 health care deductible better? . since the aca i now have a $3000 deductible for medical care and $1500 deductible for prescriptions. in effect i pay $200 a month for insurance that does not pay for anything. i will not meet those deductibles within 12 months unless something catastrophic happens (and i cant afford that). i fail to see how this is improving health care in america. all it has done is ensure people go to the doctor less frequently even if they need care and and that they don't get the medications they need.,many people have expressed frustration as you have about the cost of health insurance -- in particular the out-of-pocket costs that come with many health plans. insurers are now required to accept everyone who applies (before the law they frequently refused to sell coverage to people with any type of pre-existing medical condition). in response they have looked for other ways to reduce costs. shifting costs of care to consumers is one way to do that. the plans do provide access to many preventive services without you having to pay anything at the time of the visit. so it's important to take advantage of that -- wellness visits vaccinations many cancer screenings etc. depending on your health condition you may able to get most of the care you need each year at no additional cost. and you mentioned a catastrophic situation which is what insurance is intended to protect against in the first place. under the law your costs are capped at $6 600 for 2015. that's a lot of money but if you were in an accident or got very sick it's a lot lower than it would be if you had no coverage or even a private insurance policy before the law took effect. still i understand your frustration. no doubt there are trade offs. everyone is now guaranteed coverage but healthcare remains very pricey for most people. you might want to revisit the marketplace during open enrollment -- november 15 - february 15 -- to see if you can find yourself a better deal.
21070,is abortion safe at 22 weeks into pregnancy? . hi i am 22 weeks pregnant and contemplating abortion. but i am worry that it could be harmful to my body or worst. i have already had 6 abortions 3 live births 1 miscarriage. i am also a little scared to have this baby because all my pregnancy were high- risk and it put me and my babies lives at risk. yes my husband and i used a condom when i got pregnant with this baby. so i was just wonderng if it was safe or even recommended to go through with it based on my history.,i dont think it is safe the baby has already started developing its organs and everything
6603,no sores or visible symptoms could i have herpes? . for a month have been having these symptoms: pain/oversensitivity on penis head occasional testicular pressure slight redness on tip of penis occasional urethra burning. all symptoms come and go most consistent symptom is the pain/sensitivity on penis head. have been to urologist and tested for gonohrrea and chlamydia both negative. prescribed 30 days of cipro i am 2 weeks in with no improvement. told it may be prostatitis but starting to worry about something worse.,prostatitis can certainly cause those symptoms especially if your doctor examined your prostate and determined that you did indeed have this disease. please stay on your cipro but make a follow up appointment with your urologist at the end of the course just in case. herpes tends to rear its ugly head shortly after the onset of symptoms so without the characteristic tiny painful blisters that are typical of this disease the chance that you have herpes is not very high. with that said it is not normal to continue to have persistent pain at the tip of your penis so something is wrong. you may have to have some additional diagnostic tests.

2719,how much salt substitute can i take with low dose lisinopril?,"a salt substitute should not be a problem. remember that salt is an acquired taste so it can take time to ""un-acquire"" it. don't use very much and try to reduce even the substitute over time. you will then. perhaps for the first time that you remember. will be able to taste the true flavor of food unaltered by salt. use other herbs like garlic peppers etc. to flavor your foods and in a few months you will not even want salt. as a matter of fact other foods that you did not prepare will tend to taste too-salty to you."

15729,i have the chills a headache and am nauseous. what is wrong with me and what do i do? . i am college basketball player. i lifted today and played basketball for a hour and a half or two. i am not low on energy or anything and this is something i would do on a normal day.,there are hundreds if not thousands of medical conditions that could cause your vague symptoms. it is impossible for me or any medical professional to be able to determine the cause of your symptoms since we do not know anything about you your medical history or have any way of examining you or ordering diagnostic tests. i would suggest that you head off to student health or an after-hour urgent care facility so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated.
8796,can you take headache relief (equate brand) medicine with tamiflu?,for the most definitive answer you should pick up the phone and consult a pharmacist. he or she can tell you what over-the-counter medications are safe to take with tamiflu (generic name: oseltamivir). in general however it should be ok to take an over-the-counter pain reliever with tamiflu. oseltamivir is an anti-viral medication. it does not contain pain relievers. if you've come down with the flu i'm sorry to hear it and wish you well!

22247,what exercises should be avoided during pregnancy?,there are certain exercises and activities that can be harmful if performed during pregnancy. they include: holding your breath during any activity. activities where falling is likely (such as skiing and horseback riding). contact sports such as softball football basketball and volleyball. any exercise that may cause even mild abdominal trauma such as activities that include jarring motions or rapid changes in direction. activities that require extensive jumping hopping skipping bouncing or running. deep knee bends full sit-ups double leg raises and straight-leg toe touches. bouncing while stretching. waist-twisting movements while standing. heavy exercise spurts followed by long periods of no activity. exercise in hot humid weather.
475,i'm 48 years old and i have adult acne. also the skin around my nose flakes. what can i do about these two issues?,you may be suffering from a combination of acne and seborrheic dermatitis (sd). typically sd sufferers will have flaky skin around the nose and hairline in combination with dry patches. there is usually an underlying fungal component (with sd) that can be treated with an antifungal cream and/or shampoo. flare-ups can be controlled with over-the-counter corticosteroids. once this component is under control your acne will be easier to treat. your acne prevention regimen should include an antimicrobial facial wash that contains benzoyl peroxide acid or alpha-hydroxy acid a mild exfoliating agent and salicylic acid to help clear your clogged pores.
1121,is there some kind of injection you can get into your scalp to make your hair grow faster?,some hair specialists use mesotherapy which is the injection of finasteride or minoxidil directly into the scalp to increase hair growth. however no studies have shown that this works any better than the traditional oral or topical use of finasteride or minoxidil.
19083,if i get the seasonal flu vaccine this early will i still be protected in february?,yes. flu vaccine protects for six to eight months according to the cdc.
9715,i have a disabled son who i have been paying medical insurance for at the tune of $550 a month. we have been afraid to let it drop because of his spinal condition. after three times of trying to get him on disability or some type of assistance to no avail i'm afraid to look into a new program only to lose what we currently have. as my husband and i age i don't know how long we will be able to support him or his insurance.,your son can no longer be denied insurance based on his medical condition so you would be well served to explore all the insurance options available through the new health insurance marketplaces to see if you can find a plan at a lower cost. start your search at healthcare. gov.
9222,i have stretch marks on my hips and thighs from gaining and losing weight. how can i get rid of these? will lasers help?,feel at least comforted that everybody has stretch marks so this is a universal problem from women. i have not seen one person ever who doesn't have stretch marks. what causes stretch marks is the rate of gain of weight. it just happens that if you gain weight at a certain rate a little bit faster than your skin can grow that's when a stretch mark occurs but you often don't see it till you lose the weight that's when you start to see it. so trying to control the weight is one way to avoid future stretch marks. once the stretch mark is there the sad truth is that there is absolutely no treatment out there that will eliminate it. people have tried a whole bunch of different things like lasers and retinoids and the doctor who figures out how to really truly solve the stretch mark will be a very well-loved and very rich doctor because everybody wants this taken care of. but as of yet there are some studies ongoing using lasers to treat stretch marks but there is nothing that i have seen that i think is effective and worth spending money on to try to treat a stretch mark.
4352,what sort of home remedies can a tinea pedis fungal infection be treated with? . i've had the infection for several months now and the anti-fungal spray tinactin hasn't helped one bit nor is keeping my feet dry on a daily basis.,most helpful answer try a different antifungal cream. there are many highly-effective ones over the counter. your pharmacist can help you choose one. while there are home remedies out there none are really that effective. the ones that seem to get better may have simply spontaneously improved on their own and people attribute the cure to the last thing they tried. i am a fan of scientifically-proven treatments.
5754,are lipotropic b -12 injections safe for weight loss?,safe? yes. effective? no. if you lose weight it will be because of the calorie restriction and exercise not b12. i just want to say go with natural way to lose weight rather than any injections or pills.
18480,semen analysis. 22 yrs old. doctor said i was unable to have kids but my wife is now pregnant. we need a second opinion. my semen analysis:. . period of sexual abstinence : 2 days. volume : 2. 0ml. ph seminal fluid quantitative: 7. 2. viscosity : not viscous. motile: 50 %. progressive: 40%. non-progressive: 10%. immotile : 50%. normal: 56%. abnormal head: 44%. abnormal midpiece: 0%. abnormal tail: 0%. seminal fluid quantitative:77. 5 x 10(6)/ml (20-250),hi have a good read through this link from webmd it will answer a lot of you questions and even some you have not asked yet? <link> well as for being pregnant have you had a test done yet to confirm it? i would then take it and show it to your doctor but as you will read if your sperm count was low you can still father a child. i did read somewhere of a guy they took just 7 sperms from him and it was done by ivf and his wife had a baby so not the millions some of have produced. do hope this helps you. good luck
8727,"why is my clitoral hood turning dark (almost black) in a strange pattern very sore to the touch and has no bump? . i have had an ""open"" kind of hood since i was born where i can see the clitoral glans just by looking down at it. now the entire area of the clitoral hood is turning black. not raised like a mole but more like broken blood vessels in a flat large unpatterned area. not a circle not a bump. it hurts all of the time but especially when i touch it. it does not hurt to go pee.",i'm sorry you're experiencing this. i don't know what's causing this situation but i'd have it checked out if i were you especially because you obviously have concerns about it (i would too). it could be something minor but then again you may have injured that delicate tissue somehow. if that's the case a gynecologist can tell you if it needs to be treated. i'd recommend calling today for an appointment with your gyn to find out what's going on. i wish you all the best!
18086,will a cortisone shot cause indigestion or heartburn?,corticosteroid injections commonly are given to relieve pain in the joints such as the elbow or the neck. the medication works by reducing inflammation which in turn can relieve pressure on a nerve and reduce pain. a corticosteroid shot for joint or soft tissue pain should not cause any side effect like indigestion. generally speaking the medication stays in the local area of the injection and does not travel throughout the body. corticosteroids also can be administered by injection into a vein. this type of injection is used to treat an allergic reaction or asthma. while it's unlikely this type of steroid injection would cause indigestion it's not impossible. if you received a cortisone shot for joint pain then your heartburn likely is not related. hope this helps!
4790,is there a home test for checking potassium. can i check my potassium levels at home,no. there is no home test.
2907,is genital herpes spread through bodily fluids or just skin-to-skin contact?,"both. the virus can be spread in both ways. most people do not have apparent symptoms for many months or even years after becoming infected. those who do have symptoms during the initial period will usually notice them about 4 to 7 days after being infected. my sincere advice is that you to read and closely follow the steps & methods detailed in ""one minute herpes cure"" by allison freeman. check this link <link>"
1331,does hpv cause yeast infections in women?,no. human papillomavirus (hpv) causes genital warts in men and women and abnormal growths on the cervix that can advance to cervical cancer. vaginal yeast infections are almost all caused by candida a yeast that lives harmlessly in the vagina in many women. if there is a disruption of the normal balance of organisms in the vagina (most often after taking antibiotics) candida can grow excessively causing symptoms of a yeast infection. the skin of the vagina becomes irritated often with itching pain with urination or sex and sometimes a thick white discharge. ever since i have been diagnosed with high risk hpv and my doctor has been treating the abnormal cells located high up in my vaginal walls the treatment has been causing me yeast infections. for 16 weeks i have been using imiquimod %5 cream to treat the cells by applying deep into the vagina 3 times a week then rinsing with a betadine solution once a week and so far that hasn't worked but i have had non-stop yeast infections. now on monday tomorrow i start using fluorouracil %5 cream 1 applicator full once a week which is another skin cancer cream normally used topically but i will be using deep in the vaginal walls. i'm a single woman in my mid forties and this whole thing is so fustrating and just want it to be over and now i'm teriffied to date and let things go to another level. however while i am being treated i have been told by my doctor not to have any sex so i guess its good that i'm not in a relationship right now. seriously is there any hope out there because i'm so tired of feeling irritated down there.
4263,type your question here. ve broken my cartilage of nose while playing criket how can be it cured,your first and most important step it to determine the extent of your nose injury. this may take imaging studies so i would suggest that you see a medical professional like an ent specialist so you can be properly examined and diagnosed first.

12818,i gave oral sex to my girlfriend 1 week after getting a cold sore. could she contract genital herpes? . i know that the chances are probably there. i guess i'm asking how likely is it to happen. she gets cold sores already. i treated the cold sore as soon as i saw the first sign. its just a small scab and mark now on my lip.,i cannot estimate the likelihood of herpes transmission since there are just too many variables. some people shed herpes virus even when they do not have an obvious herpetic lesion. as a rule do not have oral sex with anyone when you have or recently-had a cold sore (herpes simplex). there is really nothing you can do about it after the act other than wait. and hope that you did not transmit this herpetic virus. if you did she will most certainly let you know.
20877,should i stop excercising if i have eye floaters? my ophthalmologist told me to do so and not to hold stuff that weigh. my father is 64 years old. he has been seeing spots in his vision in form of grey circles in the last four days (in his left eye only). his ophthalmologist reassured him that the retina is fine but he told him that he needs to stop exercising and needs to stop holding stuff that weigh too much for a period of one month. he also asked him to visit him immediately if he sees spots during this month. my father plays tennis so can having eye floaters be an obstacle for him to stop exercising?,hi as this is something new to him get him to his doctor and get his bp checked out it could be from that hbp can create this kind of problem. good luck
22163,what causes eczema?,doctors do not know the exact cause of eczema but a defect of the skin that impairs its function as a barrier possibly combined with an abnormal function of the immune system are believed to be important factors. studies have shown that in people with atopic dermatitis there are gene defects that lead to abnormalities in certain proteins (such as filaggrin) that are important in maintaining the barrier of normal skin. some forms of eczema can be triggered by substances that come in contact with the skin such as soaps cosmetics clothing detergents jewelry or sweat. environmental allergens (substances that cause allergic reactions) may also cause outbreaks of eczema. changes in temperature or humidity or even psychological stress can lead to outbreaks of eczema in some people.
5716,is it normal for a patient to have anxiety when having an uncurable severe illness?,"yes. anxiety and/or depression would be a normal human response to knowing that you have an ""uncurable severe illness"". treating the anxiety is just as important as trying to treat the illness. i have two types of multiple sclerosis. have had it since i was 16. it is very normal to have anxiety. don't let it overcome you though. take charge as much as can handle and don't hesitate to ask for help. good luck i am a cna that works at an independent living apartment complex for age group 60-100 (just celebrated a 101sst birthday there) many of my people are not far off from being put on hospice. some get depressed for a bit and others look at it as a blessing. in my experience the persons age has alot to do with how much anxiety is shown. one commonality is they all have such great attitudes about living and seeing what the future holds. the 'anxiety' is most definitely present at the beginning. most of them want to make the most out of the time they have left leaving out any treatments that will cause them to be bed bound or will slow them down in anyway. i think the sooner a person comes to terms with their condition and lives to the fullest of their capabilities anxiety will ease."
29447,how to cure eye allergy?,your doctor is right in saying that your son has allergic conjunctivitis. eye allergies called allergic conjunctivitis are a common condition that occurs when the eyes react to something that irritates them called an allergen. the most common allergens are dust and pollens. the eyes produce a substance called histamine to fight off the allergen. as a result the eyelids and conjunctiva (the thin filmy membrane that covers the inside of your eyelids) become red swollen and itchy with tearing and burning. the key to treating eye allergies are avoid or limit contact with the substance causing the problem. avoid rubbing eyes instead do cold compresses. use antiallergic eye drop like olopatadine along with lubricating eye drop. we prescribe mild steroid in pulse dose in case allergy is severe. in longstanding allergy we also prescribe tacrolimus (talimus ointment) with very good results. some doctors also prescribe cyclosporine instead of tacrolimus and that is also effective in longstanding cases. this will help you and i am very sorry to say that there is no medicine to cure allergy. only way is to stay away from all those things that you are allergic to. also this allergy will trouble him every year and usually after puberty it decreases. for further information consult an eye care ophthalmologist online --> <link>
22502,how does fibromyalgia affect pregnancy?,with pregnancy there's a tremendous increase in the amount of hormones in your body. along with weight gain your body is out of balance and your shape takes a different form. most women experience nausea and fatigue especially during the first three months of pregnancy. is it any wonder that fibromyalgia symptoms are often misdiagnosed and thought to be a normal part of pregnancy? there are few studies on fibromyalgia in pregnant women. however a study at temple university found that women with fibromyalgia had more symptoms of pain during pregnancy than women who did not have fibromyalgia. also fibromyalgia symptoms seemed to be exacerbated during pregnancy. pregnant women with fibromyalgia may experience significant pain fatigue and psychological stress especially in the first three months.

6664,how can i convince a reluctant child to get a flu shot?,"why [not] flumist? it is an equally effective (some studies say ""more effective"") flu vaccine that can be sprayed in the nose. no needles. when i do have to negotiate with a reluctant child about a shot i do a few things: 1. i give them choices. they can have one shot (assuming they only need one) or two! 2. i can give them a ""booster"" instead of a shot. (it is the same thing but the word booster sounds less painful! ) 3. they can get it in their arm or leg where it doesn't hurt very much or their eye! (of course we don't do eye shots so this becomes an easy choice. 4. i tell them this: ""i am not supposed to do this but if you don't tell anyone i will use the little tiny baby needle. the one we use for infants instead of the big-person needle. how about that? "" 5. and finally. ""if this little ""booster"" hurts you tell the nurse right away and she will take it out immediately! "" (of course she is going to do that anyway. ) the games we play. ""convince"" a reluctant ""child"" to get a flu shot? who is the adult and who is the child. there's no convincing a child. i've seen bribery done. if it was my situation the child would have learned right from the beginning that sometimes we must do things that aren't the most pleasant but will be over soon. never lie to a child and say it won't hurt. there was one thing i taught and allowed my children to do for a shot: either alone or accompanied by me to sing as loud as possible happy birthday. it always worked and they always wanted me to sing along loud. of course the dr. was warned first."
8964,i have a history of a high frequency of bowel movements everyday. on average i go three times sometimes more in one day. i have always seemed to have an active digestive system and problems with upset stomach. it is coming to a point where everyday activities including work is being compromised. i literally have to use the restroom 3 times during a single shift at work and most likely once at home. is this normal? it makes it hard to plan activities at times and very uncomfortable at work.,i'm sorry this situation is causing you distress. normal bowel frequency can range from about three times a day to about three times a week. bowel frequency is highly individualized. since you have a history of frequent bowel movements it sounds like that's the normal rhythm of your digestive system. but it also sounds like the situation has changed recently since you say it's now interfering with work. that means you should get checked out by a health care professional. you can start with your primary care provider. he or she can help you determine if there's anything abnormal going on with your system and if it needs to be treated. best wishes as you get this sorted out! elizabeth is right! if its part of your history to go that many times in a day then i wouldn't be too worried about it. i used to have to go only once per day and now i go 3x everyday. it was something to get used to so i totally understand how it can get in the way of work. i feel your pain but i've learned you have to be intune with your body and pay attention to what it needs. needing to go is a basic biological need and no one is going to stop you if you gave to go!

22684,tsh level is 115. 3. about how long have i been in menopause? does it gradually increase? . partial hysterectomy 5 yrs ago. still have ovaries. getting anxiety and hot flashes.,"i feel i need to clarify that thyroid function (measured by tsh levels) is not related to menopause. i think what confuses some people is that the symptoms of low thyroid levels (hypothyroidism) can mirror the symptoms of menopause. when a person experiences hypothyroidism the symptoms can include fatigue depression mood swings and sleep disturbances. these symptoms also can arise as estrogen levels fall during menopause. thus an elevated tsh (which stands for ""thyroid stimulating hormone "" by the way) result like yours only indicates how well your thyroid is functioning. it does not indicate whether or not you are now in menopause. i hope you are following up with a medical professional about your tsh results. a tsh of 115 indicates your thyroid is not producing enough thyroid hormones to meet your body's needs. people with elevated tsh readings often must take prescription thyroid hormone pills. if your healthcare provider has not suggested this you should ask why not. wishing you well!"

215,which is the most effective herbal remedy for weight loss? . i am suffering from obesity and feeling uncomfortable and also demoralized because of your extra pounds,"there is no convincing evidence that any herbal remedy will help people lose and maintain weight loss. here is the run down on the most promising ones. i highly recommend you spend some time figuring out why you carry excess weight and then focus on that. some people eat because they have dieted for years and feel deprived. others may eat because of stress or due to uncomfortable feelings. other simply eat very large portions and don't know when to stop which may be because they were raised to ""clean their plates"" and this habit continued. once you get a good handle on what is causing your weight you can then work on getting the help you need to deal with it. that might be seeing a therapist and registered dietitian (go to eatright. org to find one in your area). if you have significant health problems due to your weight you might even benefit from weight loss surgery or a medically supervised diet. for more tips on finding the right program for you see this article. most people can lose weight but it's keeping it off that is the hardest. if you work on the reasons you are overweight and not just the symptom of the weight itself you will be more likely to succeed. good luck! if you want to reduce your weight in herbal manner then honey will be the good solution for it. honey contains 22 amino acids and a variety of minerals essential for its metabolism and hence is helpful in preventing obesity. dissolve half a teaspoon of cinnamon powder in a cup of boiling water. stir the mixture and cover for half an hour. filter away any big particles and add a teaspoon of honey. take it in the morning with an empty stomach about half an hour before breakfast. this is the best home remedy for weight loss. one of the most effective herbal remedy i know is the apple cider vinegar. it contains a certain fiber which is known as the pectin which helps in flushing away fats and toxins. dr schweiger - <link> green tea."

2575,we are planning to attend disney world on vacation. my granddaughter is only 9 months - what are the risks of measles? . she will be flying and attending disney world one day. is this not advisable?,your unimmunized child is at risk for measles in any crowd not just disneyland or disney world. she will likely be fine if you do not allow anyone to touch her in the stroller or play with other children. kids like to touch things so if you allow her to touch benches handles etc. places where other children have touched you need to carefully wash or sanitize her hands. you can also wait for disney world until the recent measles epidemic has abated but as far as i know most of the cases are in california (disneyland) not in florida. i don't know when you are planning this trip but you can always check with the local health authorities to see if there are any restrictions or recommendations at the time.

20031,my 1 year old has diarrhea x2 days and just got done yesterday off amoxicillin her butt is raw can i give probiotic? . if so which probiotic is the best to give for a 1 year old? and at what point do i take her to the er. her pain is very bad with such a bad diaper rash that she screams when she gets her diaper changed up to 3 times an hour due to uncontrollable diarrhea. she also is arching her back and hard to breath due to crying so bad. poor baby.,yes. you can use probiotics but that will not solve the sore bottom. not all diaper rashes are the same. some are caused simply by the acidic irritation of having diarrhea but some can be yeast or even bacterial. each would be treated differently of course. since i can't diagnose your baby over the internet i can make a little suggestion that i use for my own patients. use a combination of an anti-yeast cream (over the counter. the pharmacist can help you pick one) and 1% hydrocortisone cream (for the inflammation). rub a small amount well in those sore areas and then cover this with a barrier cream or ointment (a&d desitin zinc oxide vaseline etc. ). change the diaper frequently and make sure you wipe of all traces of stool even if you have to give them a bath. if the area is bleeding or getting worse you will need to have it examined by the pediatrician.

13241,chance of std from protected anal sex. i had anonymous anal sex with a man and i am worried that i've caught something. my penis never touched anything besides his hand while unprotected. i penetrated him with a condom on after that and he didn't penetrate me. just wondering what kind of risk i've put myself in. seriously kicking myself.,"condoms do prevent some but not all stds. herpes can be transmitted from skin to skin contact. anal sex can cause tiny tears in the lining of the rectum or anus and make you more prone to infection. i suspect you will be fine since the condom was intact and you appear to have been careful. having ""anonymous"" sex with anyone is risky however since you do not know if he is hiv positive or has an std."
8674,are these symptoms indicative of dehydration? . dark foul smelling urine extreme thirst itchy skin hemoglobin of 6. 8 confusion hard stools.,"most helpful answer the answer is: yes and no. some of your symptoms could be indicative of dehydation namely: dark colored urine extreme thirst itchy skin hard stools confusion but dehydration is not the only condition that could cause these symptoms. i hope you're following up with a medical professional about these symptoms to determine the underlying cause. regarding your ""hemoglobin"" results. i wonder if you're referring to the actual hemoglobin test or if you're referring to the "" hemoglobin a1c "" test. these are two entirely different things. basically a hemoglobin test measures your red blood cell count. a result of 6. 8 would be quite low for either a woman or a man. in fact that result would put you in the "" anemic "" category and it would require medical treatment. on the other hand a hemoglobin a1c test provides a snapshot of your blood sugar control over the preceding three months. a result of 6. 8 would be considered within the desirable range for someone with diabetes. it would be considered outside the normal range for someone without diagnosed diabetes. i would suggest you make an appointment with your primary care provider (pcp) to review your symptoms get a diagnosis and come up with a treatment plan. best to you!"

273,what ingredients should be avoided for someone who has a gluten sensitivity? . i've been tested for celiac and that's not the issue. it's just a gluten sensitivity but i'm unsure what all i should avoid besides wheat barley rye and being cautious of soy products.,"gluten is a protein found in wheat rye barley and crossbred hybrids of these grains. the good news is many foods are naturally free of gluten including fruits vegetables lean proteins nuts oils and dairy. the nutrition label can help you determine which products gluten free. the term ""gluten-free"" can be helpful but is not a regulated claim even though the fda is working to define it. when you read a label look for gluten-containing ingredients including wheat barley rye oats (due to likely cross-contamination) brewers' yeast and malt (beer). labeling laws require allergens to be labeled including wheat proteins so any food that says ""contains wheat"" is off limits. this does not apply to barley rye and oats or items that may have been cross contaminated so if there is any doubt contact the manufacturer. you might want to discuss with your healthcare provider if you can tolerate small amounts of gluten. if you can you may not need to be as vigilant as those with celiac. for more on going gluten-free check out this slideshow."

14360,i have a terrible sinus infection. could i please get an antibiotic called in asap? thank you.,sorry there are no doctors here who can prescribe for you. if you have a bad sinus infection try to get to urgent care at the very least because you need to know what kind of infection you have and they can get you the right antibiotics for it. i've beat more than a few sinus infections with lots of hot showers decongestant nasal spray to let the sinuses drain sometimes even sinus rinses and lots of hot soup with garlic. it's something of a natural antibiotic.

3751,my husband slipped on the ice about 6 days ago and hit his side. he is having alot of pain in that area. . what could we do to try to treat this? normally we would just go see a dr. ; however he just switched jobs and we have another month before we have insurance. so unfortunately seeing a physician is not really an option.,"insurance or not making an accurate diagnosis is required before a treatment plan is determined. i know this injury is untimely but these things happen. if your car broke down your car insurance wouldn't fix it. you would have to come up with the money to do it. the same deal goes with your husband. borrow money. charge the visit to a credit card. have the facility bill you and pay later. either way the evaluation needs to be done first. there is absolutely no way for me or any medical professional to be able to tell you the reason for his ""side pain"" since we don't even know which side or the location on that side. without knowing his medical history i couldn't even recommend ibuprofen. get him the care he needs. worry about paying for it later. an urgent care facility is a fraction of the cost of an er so this is what i suggest. most even have their own x-rays."

29286,hello i'm 20 years old and i've always seemed to have almost random outbursts of anger. i first started this when i was in 1st grade where i would have 1-2 hour bursts of anger followed by a long fit of crying. i would completely freak out and start trying to injure myself start shouting resisting people trying to calm me etc. it would be quite frequent (at least once a week) and would continue up until the end of 6th grade where after 6th grade i thought it was gone for good. until i had an episode when i was a sophomore in high school when walking around with friends. it was the same as before punching a stone wall shouting incoherently the exact same type of thing. after that i usually have an episode about one time every year sometimes two. sometimes i'll also feel very depressed for about 1-2 hours as well with it just ending almost abruptly. i've always absolutely hated what this is and i want to have an idea of what is going on. thanks for reading.,the description provided indicates that you might be having a mood disorder (bipolar disorder). but additional history and a face to face discussion is needed to know the exact problem. for a proper diagnosis and treatment you might benefit by consulting a psychiatrist who can take a complete history and then decide on the treatment measures.

29652,i touched a used needle. is there any chance of me getting hiv infection?,the risk of infection from needlestick injuries depends on: the factors that influence exposure to a greater volume of blood (for example: visible blood on the device needle which has been placed directly into an artery or a vein of an hiv positive person). viral load of the source patient. deeper injuries and by hollow-bore needles (especially those needles with larger gauges). diabetics use fine gauge needle and that too for injecting insulin into the skin rather than into a blood vessel. moreover the needlestick injury you have mentioned here actually did not prick deep enough you just touched the needle and i think your chances are minimal if at all. are you unsure about the hiv status of the patient? if you are sure that the used needle belongs to him and no one else and if you know the person very well you may straight away go and tell him/her about the incident and your reason to be anxious and inquire about the person's hiv status. that would be the easiest way. you may get a hiv combo test (antigen and antibody based test) done after 1 month of exposure for your own peace of mind. consult a hiv aids specialist online for further help --> <link>

22513,how can human immunodeficiency virus hiv infection be prevented?,you can keep from getting hiv by avoiding behaviors that might result in contact with infected blood semen or vaginal fluids. practice safe sex to prevent hiv. always use a condom during sexual activity unless you are in a relationship with one partner who does not have hiv or other sex partners. if you do have sex with someone who has hiv it is important to practice safe sex and to be regularly tested for hiv. reduce your number of sex partners preferably to one partner. talk with your sex partner or partners about their sexual history as well as your own sexual history. find out whether your partner has engaged in high-risk behaviors. avoid alcohol and drugs which can impair both your judgment and your immune system. people who know and understand safer sex practices may not practice them when they are under the influence of alcohol or drugs. do not share intravenous (iv) needles syringes cookers cotton cocaine spoons or eyedroppers with others if you use drugs. if you are hiv-positive (infected with hiv) or have engaged in sex or needle-sharing with someone who could be infected with hiv take precautions to avoid spreading the infection to others. tell your sex partner or partners about your behavior and whether you are hiv-positive. follow safe sex practices such as using condoms. do not donate blood plasma semen body organs or body tissues. do not share personal items such as toothbrushes razors or sex toys that may be contaminated with blood semen or vaginal fluids. the risk of a woman spreading hiv to her baby can be greatly reduced if she is on medicine that reduces her viral load (hiv rna) to undetectable levels during pregnancy if she receives azt (zdv) before the baby is born and if she does not breast-feed her baby. the baby should also receive treatment after it is born. if you do not regularly engage in high-risk behaviors for hiv such as having unprotected sex or injecting drugs and you feel you have been exposed this way contact your doctor as soon as possible. he or she may recommend medicine if your exposure was within the past 72 hours. 7 webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.
8635,what is your opinion on olive leaf extract?,"i guess i'm going to assume you're asking about olive leaf extract for anti-aging or immune support as these are the two new ""miracle"" uses for the product. i can tell you there are no human studies that support any claims of anti-aging effects or immune support from the use of olive leaf extract. to me that says it all. if there's no science behind it i personally wouldn't spend my money on it. diet supplements like olive leaf extract aren't highly regulated in the u. s. they undergo some level of review for safety but they aren't tested for example to see if they really do everything the makers claim they do. that's why i like to rely on real scientific studies before i put my faith in a supplement. that's about all i can tell you. good luck!"

17720,what exams and tests help doctors to evaluate or test people for inguinal hernia?,the diagnosis of inguinal hernia is usually based on your medical history and a physical exam. tests such as ultrasound and ct scans are not usually needed to diagnose an inguinal hernia. in most cases a doctor can identify an inguinal hernia during a physical exam. an examination of urine ( urinalysis ) may be done to rule out a urinary tract infection. a urinary tract infection or kidney stone may cause pain in the groin that can be mistaken for hernia pain. further tests may be done to rule out other conditions that could be contributing to the hernia such as colon or prostate cancer or lung diseases that cause chronic coughing. if surgery is planned other tests may be needed to evaluate the status of any current health problems such as lung heart or bleeding problems. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

1475,this morning i woe up with large floater i m left eye is there anything i can do to resolve this without going to md?,floaters are usually small spots that move in your field of vision. they are caused by specks of protein floating in the vitreous humor—the jelly-like substance in the back of the eye. floaters become more common as we get older. though usually harmless floaters can be a warning sign of vision-threatening conditions like retinal tears and detachments or bleeding inside the eye. seek immediate medical help if any of these are associated with floaters: • a sudden increase in number of floaters • a change in your floaters • flashing lights • changes or decrease in your vision • any eye pain • trauma to your eye • you have had eye surgery if you have a large new floater you should also call your eye doctor right away. if your eye doctor decides that the floaters are harmless there is usually no treatment. looking up and down can sometimes move the floaters out of your field of vision. if they become a problem for you your eye doctor may discuss the possibility of surgery to remove them.

8042,what is the difference between a stroke and a subdural hematoma?,this is an excellent question! i can understand why this distinction could be confusing to some people because both stroke and a subdural hematoma involve bleeding inside the skull. however the two conditions are very different. in the simplest terms stroke involves bleeding inside the brain; a subdural hematoma involves bleeding outside the brain. when a stroke occurs a blood vessel within the brain tissue either ruptures or becomes blocked. this in turn deprives an area of brain tissue from receiving the oxygen-rich blood it needs to survive. stroke can occur without warning and often includes one or more of these symptoms : one-sided body weakness numbness or loss of function slurred speech trouble finding the right words sudden vision changes sudden balance changes severe headache a subdural hematoma on the other hand occurs in the tissues that surround the brain. many people don't realize the brain is wrapped in several layers of tissue for protection. first comes the scalp; then the bone tissue of the skull; then a tough fibrous layer of tissue called the 'dura mater;' then a webby layer called 'arachnoid' tissue; and lastly a delicate tissue-paper like layer called the 'pia mater. ' the brain itself lies below all of these layers of tissue. a subdural hematoma is a blood clot that forms due to a bleed that occurs below the dura mater and above the arachnoid tissue. a bleed can occur here due to trauma such as a concussion or other head injury. a subdural hematoma can cause pressure inside the skull to rise compressing delicate brain tissue and causing cells to die. it is a medical emergency that requires a procedure called a craniotomy to remove the blood clot and relieve swelling and pressure inside the skull. keep in mind i have greatly simplified the anatomy in this description. but i hope it helps you better understand how a stroke is different from a subdural hematoma!

10564,what is the best diet plan for losing baby weight if you are breastfeeding?,breastfeeding moms should not go on weight loss diets because they need plenty of calories to lactate and provide the sole source of nutrition to their infants. even if the weight doesn't come off as fast as if you were not breastfeeding take comfort in knowing you are doing the best thing for the baby. breast milk is designed by mother nature to give your baby everything he or she needs for growth and development for the first several months. good nutrition is imperative. your diet affects the quality of the breast milk whereas the quantity is based on how much you nurse.
12296,what are the symptoms of chlamydia?,the majority of women with chlamydia do not have symptoms. cervicitis (infection of the uterine cervix) is the most common manifestation of the infection. while about half of women with chlamydial cervicitis have no symptoms others may experience vaginal discharge or abdominal pain. infection of the urethra is often associated with chlamydial infection of the cervix. women with infection of the urethra (urethritis) have the typical symptoms of a urinary tract infection including pain upon urination and the frequent and urgent need to urinate. chlamydia is very destructive to the fallopian tubes. it can also cause severe pelvic infection. if untreated about 30% of women with chlamydia will develop pelvic inflammatory disease. symptoms of pelvic infection include fever pelvic cramping abdominal pain or pain with intercourse. pelvic infection can lead to difficulty in becoming pregnant or even sterility. occasionally if the infection is severe enough a localized area of infection and pus (an abscess) forms and major surgery may be necessary and even lifesaving. because it is common for infected women to have no symptoms chlamydial infection is often untreated and results in extensive destruction of the fallopian tubes fertility problems and tubal pregnancy. chlamydial infection like gonorrhea is associated with an increased incidence of premature births. in addition the infant can acquire the infection during passage through the infected birth canal leading to serious eye damage or pneumonia. for this reason all newborns are treated with eye drops containing an antibiotic that kills chlamydia. treatment of all newborns is routine because of the large number of infected women without symptoms and the dire consequences of chlamydial eye infection to the newborn.

717,i want to know if adding olive oil to my diet could help lower my cholesterol.,olive oil is a fat and like any fat contains about 100 calories per tablespoon. so keep in mind: olive oil is just as caloric as other fats and can contribute to weight gain if consumed in high amounts. olive oil does contain heart-healthy fats which are associated with lower blood cholesterol levels. but you can't just pour olive oil all over an otherwise unhealthy diet and expect your cholesterol levels to suddenly go down. making dietary changes to control your cholesterol levels is a twofold process. first increase the amount of fiber in your diet such as the fiber found in oatmeal fruits and vegetables. second decrease the amount of animal fats and saturated fats you consume such as the fats found in butter whole milk cream sausage bacon and heavily marbled cuts of beef. exercise is also good for your heart health and cardiovascular function. but you have to address any issues with your diet. i suggest using olive oil-based cooking sprays to sauté your vegetables as well as using olive oil as a salad dressing base. canola oil is a good choice as well.

1075,what are some tips for using lubricants during sex?,"many people have questions about how to use lubricant for more comfortable pleasurable sex. here are some tips you might consider: 1. choose the right lubricant for the right situation. water-based lubricant and silicone-based lubricant are well suited for latex condoms (oil-based products such as olive oil oil-based lubricants or massage oil can cause latex condoms to tear). silicone-based lubricants are better suited for sex play in the bath shower or hot tub as water-based lubricants will wash away. 2. apply the lubricant to your or your partner's fingertips for more careful application and less chance of spilling it onto the bed or floor. 3. next use your or your partner's fingers to apply the lubricant to the parts that need to 'fit together"" well such as around a woman's vaginal opening or on a man's penis. if you're using lubricant for sex toy play consider applying some lubricant to the sex toy as well. 4. water-based lubricant is easily absorbed into the body so if sex goes on for some time water-based lubricant may need to be re-applied. small dabs of water can also help to re-activate the lubricant. . are you having problems with seepage or drilling? tactical oilfield products are the best products for reducing friction smoother drilling and controlling lost circulation in see pages."

21311,what causes a searing moving pain throughout my thighs and calfs when sleeping. it's after an hour on the eliptical. i have chronic leg cramps overnight especially in my right foot where i have hardware from a broken ankle. occasionally the cramps turn into a searing moving pain that travels through the muscles making it impossible to stand and walk the cramps out. it must be from dehydration after exercise although i do drink powerade zero throughout my workout and at least 15oz of water at night.,my opinion it has to do with the fact that you just strenuously exercised the muscles in your legs and with going to bed right after you didn't give your muscles proper time to relax with a good stretching period after your workout. they are probably cramping and tightening up. i would suggest you try to hydrate before during and after your workout and give yourself a good 10 minute stretching cool down before heading to bed.

6542,i have this huge pimple on my chin that is very painful & has not gone down in size. how can i get it to go down? . it is aprox. pea size. i have used heat and a benzoyal poroxide each night.,first stop messing with it. you will not cure this huge zit by squeezing it. as matter of fact you will likely make it worse. this pimple most likely has a secondary infection so topical antibiotics (not the benzyl peroxide) would be most helpful. these are available over-the-counter. as unattractive as a band-aid on the chin can be it would be best to cover it up. not only will this keep germs from spreading it will hold the antibiotic ointment or cream in place. these can get out of hand relatively quickly so if you are experiencing a progressive worsening (increased area of redness more swelling increased pain) an oral antibiotic (and a visit to your medical provider) would be advised.

13765,how does substance abuse affect schizophrenia?,some people who abuse drugs show symptoms similar to those of schizophrenia. therefore people with schizophrenia may be mistaken for people who are affected by drugs. most researchers do not believe that substance abuse causes schizophrenia. however people who have schizophrenia are much more likely to have a substance or alcohol abuse problem than the general population. substance abuse can make treatment for schizophrenia less effective. some drugs like marijuana and stimulants such as amphetamines or cocaine may make symptoms worse. in fact research has found increasing evidence of a link between marijuana and schizophrenia symptoms. in addition people who abuse drugs are less likely to follow their treatment plan. schizophrenia and smoking addiction to nicotine is the most common form of substance abuse in people with schizophrenia. they are addicted to nicotine at three times the rate of the general population (75 to 90 percent vs. 25 to 30 percent). the relationship between smoking and schizophrenia is complex. people with schizophrenia seem to be driven to smoke and researchers are exploring whether there is a biological basis for this need. in addition to its known health hazards several studies have found that smoking may make antipsychotic drugs less effective. quitting smoking may be very difficult for people with schizophrenia because nicotine withdrawal may cause their psychotic symptoms to get worse for a while. quitting strategies that include nicotine replacement methods may be easier for patients to handle. doctors who treat people with schizophrenia should watch their patients' response to antipsychotic medication carefully if the patient decides to start or stop smoking.

6054,does vagina blood kill sperm and prevents pregnancy?,most helpful answer no the sperm are just fine swimming through a little vaginal blood. vaginal blood will not prevent pregnancy but having sex during a true menstrual period means that you are not ovulating. if you are not ovulating you cannot conceive. sperm can be viable for a week or so trapped in vaginal or cervical mucous so having unprotected sex toward the end of your period is iffy so never count on this as a 100% method of birth control. some women will have vaginal bleeding mid-cycle (at a time of ovulation) so don't get fooled. for that extra-added insurance it is always wise for couples to use condoms.

20267,"what do i do when my anxiety causes me mental and physical pain? . ive had anxiety since i was a kid. i dont take medications for it. i cant afford them. ive been trying to live with it and until recently ive done nothing about it. im tired of feeling like this its causing me emotional and physical pain. my relationships with friends and family members have been suffering. it often causes me to ""wig out"". when this occurs i have trouble breathing and chest pain. my whole mood just sours. i need help and i dont know whats wrong. what can i do?","it is not good to sit on your anxiety and do nothing. yes it does cause emotional and physical pain. definitely. i've been through it still battle it and know what you mean. you must become proactive. get started immediately to help yourself. few people will understand how you feel. unfortunately. you will have to do a lot but not everything alone. maybe this (below) will help you in some way? i hope so. if money is a barrier and you are suffering which you seem to be consult with your doctor or a free clinic doctor about using a regimen of ipipromol - which is not a real expensive prescription. also it is not habit forming (get opinions from your doc to verify but often us docs do not know this item but they could look it up) like xanax or lorazepam and can lessen your anxiety level in a day or two (1) to help you sleep (for renewed energy) and (2) feel more normal and balanced to be able to map out a plan to deal more fully with your underlying problems. if you cannot afford a doctor you must find a free mental health clinic somewhere nearby that you can get to without too many hassles for some help with diagnoses. they are out there. even if you have to take a bus -whatever- make the effort! there is a reasonable chance that with anxiety there also is depression. both things should and must be treated to resume a truly ""normal life. "" it'll take time but don't hesitate to be active right now get started get on the phone see where you might get opipromol (it works quickly and is not too strong) and find that free mental health clinic. you can do it. get help from anyone willing and trustworthy. best of luck to you my friend. there is help out there somewhere. look for it right now."

14931,what is the treatment for prostatitis?,treatment for acute bacterial prostatitis is a prescription for antibiotics by mouth usually ciprofloxacin (cipro) or tetracycline (achromycin). home care includes drinking plenty of fluids taking medications for pain control and getting rest. if the patient is acutely ill or has a compromised immune system (for example is taking chemotherapy or other immune-suppression drugs or has hiv/aids) hospitalization for intravenous antibiotics and care may be required. chronic bacterial prostatitis treatment chronic bacterial prostatitis treatment is with long-term antibiotics up to eight weeks with ciprofloxacin (cipro cipro xr) sulfa drugs (for example sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim [bactrim]) or erythromycin. even with appropriate therapy this type of prostatitis can recur. it is uncertain as to why but it may be due to a poorly emptying bladder. a small amount of stagnant urine allows the potential for recurrent infection to occur. this situation can be caused by benign prostatic hypertrophy (bph) bladder stones or prostate stones. chronic prostatitis without infection treatment chronic prostatitis without infection treatment addresses chronic pain control and may include physical therapy and relaxation techniques as well as tricyclic antidepressant medications. other medication possibilities include alpha-adrenergic blockers. tamsulosin (flomax) and terazosin (hytrin) are drugs that block the nonheart adrenaline receptors and are used in treating bph and bladder outlet obstruction. allowing better bladder emptying may help minimize symptoms. asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis treatment treatment is not required for this type of prostatitis. in patients undergoing infertility assessment this inflammation may be treated with a course of either a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication (ibuprofen motrin advil) or antibiotics.

8609,if you have unprotected sex on nov 3 is it possible to tell with a home test that you are pregnant on the 18th?,the answer to this question lies in your individual menstrual cycle. depending on the brand (you need to read the box) you can take a home pregnancy test as early as a day after you miss your period. some tests claim you can test 3 to 4 days before you miss your period but testing too soon can give you a false negative result. it may be better to wait the few extra days to see if you miss your period and then test. for best results i suggest taking the test first thing in the morning when your urine is most concentrated. home pregnancy tests measure the level of human chorionic gonadatropin (hcg) in your urine. this hormone is produced in great quantities beginning shortly after fertilization of an egg occurs. by taking the pregnancy test first thing in the morning you ensure any hcg in your urine is very concentrated and easy for the test to detect. so step one: wait until you miss your period. step two: home pregnancy test. hope this helps! i had an accurate positive home test 2 weeks after conception with my 2nd child so yes it is possible. if it comes back positive best thing to do is go to the doctor and get it confirmed. thats what i did

13259,i got stitches and a filling over the stitches after tooth extraction. how long do i wait to smoke? . i went to finish a tooth extraction today that the doctor couldn't finish last friday. however he still couldnt finish it because the pain was unbearable. now he recommended me to an oral surgeon and gave me stitches and put some sort of filling ( although i'm not sure what it was) on top of my stitches. it stopped the bleeding. how long should i wait to smoke? will smoking harm that area even if i wait 4 days?,i'm pretty sure they recommend you wait at least 24 hours although it would be optimum to quit <positive_smiley> sometimes that is a little harder said than done. i was lucky to make it one hour when i smoked lol
15035,dr. said that quantity of semen improve over 6 months but not quality. is there any hope of pregnancy? . when to the doctor 6 months ago after trying to get pregnant. it was discovered that poor quality and quantity was the issue. i eat healthy exercise most morning and drink average amount of water. . 6 months later after trying wellman contraceptive the quantity of semen improved but not the quality. therefore still disappointed with the news and outcome. is there any hope?,"a lot depends on why your quality is low. i think you mean something other than a contraceptive when you talk about this ""wellman"" product because contraceptive means that it would prevent pregnancy. some men have poor quality sperm if their testes are too warm for too long. are you either wearing no underwear or wearing boxers? i know you say your diet is good but are you getting a little fat every day and eating plenty of fruits and vegetables and protein? you want to find out what is affecting your quality and fix that if you can."

19065,should i send my 2 year old to a doctor after 7 days of yellow green mucous nasal discharge? . he started with mild 38 degree fever for 3 days clear mucous on day 1 and 2. mucous started to become yellow/green with bad chesty cough that sounds phlegmy.,maybe. yellow-green mucous is not a definitive sign of a bacterial infection in a two year old but it could be. this color change is usually caused by stagnation of the flow of mucous just the way a pond turns green if there is not a good in and out flow of water. two year olds do not blow their noses. if your child is ill or feverish. if he seems to be getting progressively worse. then yes seeing his medical provider would be a wise decision.
8977,male 47 i had uti last month treated well. i have lost sensation in groin/penis. erection/ejuculate normal. pl advise. i had uti mild and uncomplictaed twice in one year but both time treated completely. second time the uti was mild in symptoms and the only problem was pain during ejuculation. i was treated with antibiotic for 10 days. after treatment pain disappeared and i felt normal. after one month i am feeling loss of feeling in entire groin. when i pinch skin around i feel less pain. incidently i have started using anti prespirant for last one month. does this possibly cause loss of feeling?,i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. your symptoms definitely deserve to be checked out by your health care provider. any time a person develops a symptom like widespread loss of sensation to a body area it's a good idea to get examined. you can start with your primary care provider or whoever treated your utis. because your uti cleared up over a month ago i wouldn't think your symptom is some weird side effect of antibiotics. and i don't think antiperspirant use would cause loss of sensation either though if you're spraying it directly on your groin area you could try stopping that to see if sensation improves. at any rate i'd recommend you make an appointment with your health care provider for an exam. best wishes to you!
15922,psychological or physiological? every time i eat eggs i get a stomach ache. if the eggs are baked in cookies cakes even meringue i am fine. but if they are just fried or scrambled baked in a quiche or in an omelet my stomach gets super acidic later and i feel nauseous. unable to move for hours. i've had this for as long as i can remember and everyone keeps telling me its psychological but i want to eat eggs they look delicious. so i am certain its an allergy or intolerance. so is it all in my head?,me too. to make matters worse i have 12 chickens and lots of eggs that i have to give away. like you eggs in other products are just fine but plain eggs are not. many people develop food intolerances. it may not be an allergy but it could be so ask your medical provider to order an egg igg (allergy test). it is not in your head.

2560,why would a family doctor slap a patient in the face hard several times/ for what reason?,there is no reason (medical or otherwise) for a doctor to slap a patient unless perhaps the patient was not breathing. but even then a slap is not therapeutic. you would need to ask this odd doctor about his/her medical justification. even if a patient made fun of his toupee. or called him a nasty name there is still no logical reason.
7619,how much zofran do i give my 2-year-old?,"the first thing that i would like to ask is ""why are you giving a 2-year-old zofran? "" zofran is a medication that is used to help nausea with chemotherapy. i hope you are not giving a child a medication that you had ""handy"" in the medicine cabinet. remember you should not give anyone medication that was not prescribed for them and children are not ""little adults. "" you can give a 2 year old zofran my son is 2 and his doctor prescribed it to him when he was sick and non stop vomiting. the dosage is 1/2 a teaspoon!"
28789,i am 52 going into menopause…feel disjointed edgy and drugged,hi. all the symptoms that you have stated are a typical presentation of a pre menopausal phase that occur in a woman’s life due to gross hormonal changes occuring in the blood. to normalise this you can take menopace tablets daily for 1-2 months depending on the severity of symptoms. this will give you relief from almost all the symptoms that you are experiencing. thanks
11870,what causes hemmoroids? . the situation appears to be rather strange. my wife and i developed hemmoroids at pretty much the same time. she did first then i did about a month later. we have now had them for several weeks. she has sought medical help and got advice on hemmoroidal creams. we have had our water tested several times. this seems like to great of a coincidence to be anything other than either a virus. yet i find no information pertaining to a virus that can cause hemmoroids or hemmoroid-like symtoms.,hemorrhoids are not caused by viruses or contaminated water. they are caused by the pressure exerted on the blood vessels around anal ring during defecation. chronic or recurrent constipation often leads to hemorrhoidal problems. while it may be a coincidence that you and your wife developed them at the same time but i am guessing that you may be of similar ages and may eat the same type of foods. <link>
20613,what is a seizure and what is epilepsy?,seizures -- abnormal movement or behavior due to unusual electrical activity in the brain -- are a symptom of epilepsy. epilepsy is a group of related disorders characterized by a tendency for recurrent seizures. non-epileptic seizures (called pseudoseizures) are not accompanied by abnormal electrical activity in the brain and may be caused by psychological issues or stress. provoked seizures are single seizures that may occur as the result of trauma low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) low blood sodium high fever or alcohol or drug abuse. fever-related (febrile) seizures may occur during infancy; children usually outgrow them by age 6. seizure disorder is a general term used to describe any condition in which seizures may be a symptom.
6192,feels like i have to pee but nothing comes out. tiny amounts then i go back and another tiny amount. worst at night. also have a cyst or something on the underside of penis. i am very weak from inactivity. i have done nothing for the last 4 years. but sit and play videogames. now i can barely sit because it hurts way too much. my bladder holds way more than 2 cups of liquid.,i do not know your age or medical history but the urge to urinate followed by a scanty amount of urine could indicate an issue with your prostate gland (you actually sit on this gland). since you sit all day long playing video games this could be one possibility. people with prostatic hypertrophy (large prostates) can definitely exhibit symptoms of this nature. you need to see a medical provider so that you can be properly examined so get out that chair. you can see a urologist or your primary care provider. since you also mentioned some sort of cyst on your penis i would suggest the urologist.
1186,how can i prevent brown spots from showing up on my skin?,to prevent brown spots from showing up on your skin the best thing you can do is avoid prolonged unprotected sun exposure. use an spf foundation or moisturizer of at least 30 or above on a regular basis. apply it before you go out in the sun rather than waiting until you are already outside.
9249,how can a dermal filler make my dark circles around my eyes go away? how much does it cost?,dermal fillers are used more and more often around the eyes with really great results. when you see a dark circle under the eye it can be from two different things. it can be from pigments or blood supply and those are the two main things. when you also see a discoloration it could be because there is a shadow effect from the skin being sunken in that area or depressed or lower than the surrounding skin. so by adding a dermal filler and putting the skin on a more even plane that alone takes away the shadow and makes the skin looks smoother. you can also use brightening creams that contain ingredients like niacinamide sepiwhite mulberry root extract or hydroquinones that can even out the skin tone and when you add ingredients in like caffeine and the niacinamide as i just mentioned that also can help with the redness and altogether that will help that area look as good as possible. you also have to add in getting enough sleep drinking enough water having a balanced diet managing your stress and if you have allergies you need to keep your allergies under control. one thing you shouldn't do is have an injection around the eyes if you have active or uncontrolled allergies because that can make that area more puffy and can make the outcome less than optimal.
16476,is there an antidepressant and a migraine medication that is safe to take together?,wellbutrin sr or xl desipramine or nortiptyline -- these ones do not use serotonin like your maxalt so you will not be overdosed on serotonin.

8298,i have severe back pain that is now radiating down my right leg. . my doctor told me i have no reflexes in my right leg my right ankle and my left ankle. he is sending me for an emg test next week. i have three autoimmune diseases in addition to a clotting disorder as well. any ideas with this back issue might be?,i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. you're obviously anxious to get a diagnosis and i don't blame you. that said there's not much value in speculating about what may be causing your symptoms. your doctor is ordering appropriate tests and you have a complicated case due to your other conditions. i know it's hard to wait (not to mention scary! ) but waiting is your best bet. trust your doctor. hang in there! i hope you get answers soon!
13583,how can i prevent a sting reaction?,to avoid a serious reaction to a bee or wasp sting carry a bee-sting kit (be sure you know how to administer a self-injection). you should also wear a medic alert bracelet or necklace describing your allergy. if you have had a severe reaction to a sting and a positive venom skin test venom immunotherapy -- a series of weekly shots of venom -- works well to prevent anaphylaxis. reduce your chances of being stung by avoiding brightly colored white or pastel clothing. don't use cosmetics or perfume with floral scents. food odors attract insects especially yellow jackets so be alert when you are cooking or eating outdoors.
9084,my daughter has severe itching in her hands and feet primarily at night. she cannot sleep. what could be the issue? . two days ago her doctor gave her a steroid shot and xyzal tablets. they do not seem to work. we have also given her 2 advil pm -- they do not help her sleep. she has missed six days of school as she only finally falls asleep at 5 a. m.,the source of the itch may be neurologic and not from the skin. i would recommend seeing an internist or possibly a neurologist to evaluate further.
7115,can you offer suggestions on following a non-dairy diet?,"there are three alternative ""milks"" that you can try but of the three alternative milks soy milk has the highest amount of protein and fiber and naturally contributes some of the vitamins and minerals also found in cow's milk such as magnesium and calcium. * soy milk (usually made with filtered water whole soybeans and evaporated cane juice) soy milk contributes about 8 grams high quality protein 1. 5 grams fiber 3. 5 grams fat (. 2 grams omega-3 fatty acids) 11 g carbohydrate 290 mg potassium 61 mg calcium (sometimes fortified with more calcium) 61 mg magnesium and usually fortified with vitamin d b-12 calcium riboflavin and others. *almond milk (usually made with purified water evaporated cane juice and almonds) almond milk contributes about 1 g protein 1 g fiber 2. 5 g fat 8 g carbohydrate 180 mg potassium fortified with calcium vitamin d vitamin a and e. *rice milk rice milk contributes about 1 gram protein 0 grams fiber 2 grams fat and is fortified with calcium and vitamin d. the trick is substituting soy almond or rice milk for cow's milk using soy alternatives for cheese cream cheese and yogurt and adding olive oil or canola oil instead of butter (if you need to delete this too). soy and almond mllks work best in sauces because they have a thicker consistency and are more stable at higher temperatures compared to rice milk."
15678,what can prevent vitamin d from being absorbed into your body. i was diagnosed with osteoporosis and osteopenia. i had a dexa test and blood work which showed my vit d level @ 15. dr. put me on 50 000 ius of vitamin d once a week for 8 weeks - did this 4 times. just had more blood work and my vit. d level only came up to 23 - still very low. my question is why isn't it coming up. now he has be on the same 50 000 for another 16 weeks. i also get 2 000 a day in my multi vitamin. do certain foods prevent vitamin d getting into the body.,hi here is a very interesting link it covers far more than i could think of its a good one from harvard clinic. the link <link> i do hope this answers your question. good luck
28527,i am addicted to red bull drink…50 cans a week?,hi50 cans/ week is a huge amount and will cause long term harmful effects on your body. you have to reduce the quantity if not stop it completely. abrupt and sudden stoppage of taking it may cause sudden withdrawal symptoms. so avoid doing it. best thing would be try and decrease to 40/week then 30…20…10. likewise. this is the only way you can do it. yoga and meditation will help you in achieveing de-addiction. thanks
3883,my daughter is having pvcs and palpatations. . she is an 18 year old female in college who is 5 ' 1 and weighs 97 pounds. what can cause this sudden onset? she had a stress test yesterday and her resting heart rate was 111 and higher.,many things. too much caffeine drugs/medications. or even the emotional stress of college. right now the medical provider is trying to rule out any cardiac (heart) causes for those symptoms but many times there are other factors in play. since i do not know your daughter or her medical history it would not be possible for me to be specific on the many possibilities.
9870,i have health insurance through my employer. . if the insurance doesn't meet the 10 requirements of the insurance offered on the exchange will i be required to purchase other insurance or will it be up to my employer to make changes?,you will not be required to drop your employer's insurance coverage to buy a plan on your own. though you can buy a plan through the marketplace it would likely be a mistake for you to do so. and your company may not be required to make changes either. if your company's health plan has grandfathered status it does not have to offer insurance covering the 10 essential health benefits. companies that pay medical claims out of their own funds (called self-insured plans) do not have to comply with this part of the law either. check with your hr department about these two details of your insurance.

10181,how can i save money on my health insurance?,"here's the new reality: we're all paying more for fewer health benefits. a 2010 employer health benefits survey conducted by the kaiser family foundation found that employees paid 14% more for family health coverage last year than just one year before. and an online survey just out from glassdoor. com found that cuts to health and dental benefits were on the rise during the last quarter of 2010 with more than 11% of employees surveyed seeing their benefits reduced in the past six months. what's driving costs skyward? experts cite a mix of inefficiencies within the health-care system a growing use of medical technology an aging population widespread chronic disease medical malpractice and rising prescription drug costs. all this has prompted many people to ask: ""how can i save money on my health care? "" here a few cost-saving tips to consider: negotiate. ask your doctor hospital or lab upfront how much your care will cost and then ask for a better price. to find out what's reasonable for the type of care you need you can use online tools such as healthcare blue book and vimo. be sure to ask your provider for the cpt code (common procedural terminology) that corresponds to the service you need so you can be sure you're getting an accurate comparison. some large insurers also make costs of care available to their members online. if the procedure you want or need isn't covered by your insurance plan (or you have no insurance) ask for the same rate the provider would give an insurance company. and make sure you get the agreed-upon rate in writing. most providers have their billing done by a billing company. you may need to show proof of your agreement to billing staff who didn't get the message from the doctor. pay cash: doctors like everyone else prefer to be paid right away for the services they provide. offering to pay in cash for your treatment prevents your doctor or hospital from having to bill you or wait for full payment. that convenience can put you in a stronger position to negotiate a better price on your care. watch your location: you'll pay more for the same lab work done at a hospital than you would if you had your blood drawn at a free-standing lab or your doctor's office. talk with your doctor about alternative and less expensive sites for treatment. review your bills. as i've talked about before. a large percentage of medical bills contain inaccuracies. always check for duplicate or inappropriate charges before you pay any bills. save on prescription drugs: be sure to shop for the best price on your medications because costs vary widely among different pharmacies. you can compare drug prices side-by-side among many pharmacies at both planprescriber. com and pharmacychecker. com. the national association of boards of pharmacy offers listings of online pharmacies it has accredited."
21236,is any exercise safe while taking cipro? how long after 30 days of treatment should i wait before working with weights? . i have been working out for the last 2 years and find myself in decent shape for a 50 year old male. was starting a hardcore workout plan but have stopped. i have been having some urologic issues and after having multiple scans done the doctors are not seeing anything so my doctor has put me on cipro for 30 days. he specifically told me not to lift anything heavy due to possible tendon rupture and from what i see the risk continues even for several months after completing the medication.,i do not know of any contraindications for exercise restriction while anyone is on cipro or for months after. any restrictions that your doctor recommended has nothing to do with the medication but your other health concerns. since i do not know you full medical history it is best to get patient-specific exercise parameters from your doctor -- someone who does have this information.
166,my son is 3 years old and his level is 19. 3. he is now taking 800iu daily but what what could cause his levels to drop. my son's vitamin d level continues to drop and he is always getting sick. the dr recently increased his intake to 800 iu of vitamin d when his levels dropped to 19. 3. i took him back to the dr for further testing in an attempt ot find out why his levels were dropping but his dr couldn't figure it out. since his level has dropped from 24. 6 to19. 3 he has been sick twice. i know that his level was still too low but it had been going up then it dropped again.,there are a variety of factors that can cause vitamin d blood levels to drop. first off if he's getting less sunlight or using more sunscreen than usual that could decrease the amount he gets exposed to. also if he is eating less food and drink with vitamin d (like milk) that could decrease it. if he carries excess weight that can also decrease blood levels of vitamin d. remember that the recommended daily allowance for his age is 600iu. when levels are low doctors usually give higher than recommended amounts while monitoring blood levels. the key is to work with your doctor on the right level of supplementation that will keep his levels up. for more on vitamin d deficiency in sick kids see this webmd article.
21636,person a has some sperm on his hands hands get in mouth then asks to eat me out. could i get pregnanat? . do you think its possible to get pregnant if for example my boyfriend ejaculates in his sock or something. some of the semen seeps through and gets on his hands and right after he goes to the kitchen to eat something. he eats that something with his hands-he licks his fingers etc (therefore the semen is now in his mouth). and then i arrive at his house and he asks to give me oral? . should i just avoid oral just in case? or is that really irrational of me?,the odds of your getting pregnant under the circumstances you describe is slim to none. sperm do not survive well outside their natural environment in the male reproductive organs. sperm have a hard enough time surviving inside the vagina (which is hostile to sperm) let alone taking on saliva and the mechanical crushing of mastication. especially if you're describing semen transfer from the hands to the mouth while ingesting food or a beverage the odds any sperm would survive to subsequently impregnate you during oral sex is infinitesimal. of course you should always practice safe sex (when you're truly having sex) and if you don't want to become pregnant then you have a responsibility to use some sort of birth control yourself. a condom helps protect against sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy and you increase your chances of staying pregnancy-free by using a second birth control method such as the pill or an iud. hope this helps!

2998,what do you recommend to help tighten the vagina? i have a new baby & my husband said it doesn't feel the same. . other than kegels,kegels are the best so keep at it. your husband needs to be a bit more sympathetic and patient to a woman that just passed a baby through that passageway. with a new baby you have more things on your mind right now than worrying about tightening your vagina. over time things will return to normal and there is really little that can be done other than the kegels. maybe he can do some penis exercises to increase his girth? i heard that helping with dishes housework laundry grocery shopping etc. will help. you will be back to normal in about a month. don't worry about it. i will admit that it feels pretty strange if you haven't experienced it. way too soft and loose. and i'm not a little guy either. however i am the father of nine and my wife's inards are just as wonderful as they ever were. and that's after more than thirty years. i like the advice the dr. gave. tell your husband to chill. maybe be should read more often;especially now that he is a father.

18410,in egg consuption how many a day is too many? . my dad is 72 and eats at least 21 eggs a week. he has heart disease (fh 44%) diabetes high cholesterol high bp lung problems among others. he's on lipitor plavix 2 bp pills morbic antivert buspar nexium albuterol inhaler. . his stomach is bad and most foods make it hurt but eggs don't. i know this is too many so what about egg whites?,the most recent research suggests that one whole egg a day does not increase the risk of heart disease for healthy individuals. individuals who have problems controlling their total and ldl cholesterol may want to be more cautious about eating egg yolks. for people who have heart disease it is best to limit whole egg consumption to no more than three yolks per week. the yolk contains the cholesterol so eating egg white more often should not increase the risk for heart disease.
17511,is a cortisone injection merely a pain reliever or temporary remedy?,corticosteroids are not pain relievers. they reduce inflammation. when corticosteroids relieve pain it is because they have reduced inflammation. while the inflammation for which corticosteroids are given can recur corticosteroid injections can provide months to years of relief when used properly. these injections also can cure diseases (permanently resolve them) when the problem is tissue inflammation localized to a small area such as bursitis and tendonitis.
13426,can shingles flare back up once you finish antiviral medications. i was diagnosed with shingles on my scalp on sept. 27 2015. i was prescribed famciclovir 500 mg 3x daily. i just finished the medication on oct. 2 2015 and i have noticed that there seems to be new areas on my scalp that are beginning to itch and new blisters when scratched - brings me out of my skin so to speak. could another dose of famciclovir be helpful? or needed.,herpes zoster can definitely come back but i am concerned about the accuracy of your diagnosis so i would strongly suggest that you see a dermatologist for an expert second opinion before just taking the medications again.
4896,can you drink alcohol if you have an acute kidney injury?,"not all kidney injuries are the same and i do not know anything about you (age medical history etc. ) nor the amount of alcohol that you are planning on drinking so i would suggest that you get this ""okay"" from the medical provider who is treating and managing your kidney injury."
15676,can chiropractic care reverse osteoporosis or scoliosis?,"this is kind of a ""loaded"" question. it is like saying can chiropractic care stop the sun from setting or prevent rain. osteoporosis is a bone disease with a decrease in bone density associated with aging (sun setting) or prolonged use of certain medications. scoliosis is either caused by structural abnormality of a vertebrae or idiopathic (unknown). on the flip side of that chiropractic care can certainly help relieve symptoms associated with scoliosis and in some case help manage the process. as children grow the scoliosis curvature needs to be monitored as well as any symptoms they are having. in an ideal world md's and dc's- pt's would work together to manage this process. if you want to live in an ideal world find ""specialists"" who are open minded and educated about not only what they can do but what others can do to help you as well. in the long run you are the one that has to live with whatever condition you have and no one else's ideology should be more important than that."

806,once i’m stressed how can i calm myself?,one of the greatest things that i recommend for anybody is relaxation breathing. whoever thought a breathing exercise would be a terrific thing to do? it’s very simple. you learn it in less than a minute it might take you one minute to do you can do it any time during the day anywhere it will make you feel good. how do i do relaxation breathing? what i want you to do during this exercise as we are breathing in we’re going to breathe in hold a breath and breathe out through our mouths. when you do that i want you to think about the position of your shoulders the position of your ribs where your legs and hands are. i want you to think about those things. so we’re going to begin. you breathe in through your nose hold it for a count of five out through your mouth. remember you’re thinking about the position of your shoulders as they go up and down your ribs go in and out. you’re going to do that at least three times. we don’t want you hyperventilating remember it’s got to be comfortable for you. you gradually so you do it again alright nice and slow very slow. just think about the shoulders. do it 3 to 5 times. you can do it anywhere you can out to the water cooler. if anybody hears you they’ll think you’re sighing. that’s okay. you can go out the elevator go downstairs in the elevator by yourself. you can do it. you can go to the ladies’ room the men’s room wherever you want to do it. it’s so easy. you can do it at your desk. you can do it 10 times a day if that’s what you feel you need. you can’t overdo it as long as you don’t hyperventilate and that’s fine.

7292,can asthmatics develop an advair dependency? i'm an infrequent user but find the more i use it the more i need it.,there are two types of asthma medication. one is a rescue (albuterol or xopenex) that is used as needed for symptoms. the other is a controller therapy that is used every day to prevent symptoms. advair is a controller therapy and should be used daily instead of as needed. typically use of the drug should not cause you to need it more.
9705,i'm on ssdi and must buy a certain amount of insurance to get medical because i can't afford my meds and mental health. am i okay now and will i lose medical when i reach 65 in 2 years and my health insurance goes down?,if you get your own insurance now you can shop for new coverage options through the marketplaces. once you turn 65 medicare will be available to you. you'll want to sign up for that. once you do you will no longer need your existing health insurance policy.
5161,are doctor's required to drug test someone before giving them an rx for vicodin in ny? . is drug testing without patient's knowledge or consent for a rx for vicodin in ny now a allowed by medical professionals?,vicodin is a highly-abused addictive drug. when use properly for the management of real pain it can be quite helpful. when abused and used to get high or sold on the streets it can cause unbelievable harm. i don't know the laws in ny but a medical professional has the legal and ethical responsibility to make sure his or her patient is not abusing prescription drugs. for instance if i was treating a chronic pain patient and suspected they were not taking the medicines but rather selling them a drug test would show this drug was not in her system. many patients go to several doctors and get several prescriptions for the same drug and either turn them into cash or over-treat themselves with often fatal dosages. i would tell my patient that they were being drug tested but that is just me. someone who is not being honest about their pain or their drug use would need to find someone else to take care of them.
26267,my knee locked really bad where i couldn’t unlock it without horrible pain or force?,in my opinion. your case is mostly a meniscial tear and anterior cruciate ligament partial or full tear. mri is needed to confirm it and treatment options are surgical or conservative physiotherapy or both. seeing an orthopedic specialist will help you the best.

256,is a vegan diet healthy for my 3 year old son?,with careful planning a vegan diet can meet the needs of your child. but you do have to be more vigilant about key nutrients such as iron zinc calcium vitamin d vitamin b12 and dha. because iron and zinc are not absorbed as well in plant foods include higher-than-recommended amounts. adding vitamin-c rich sources (strawberries tomatoes/tomato based products oranges kiwi and broccoli) to help absorb iron from fortified foods and plant sources. vegan children need a supplemental source of b12 (either fortified foods or supplements) because it only occurs naturally in animal foods. here are vegan foods sources for key nutrients that are important to stay on top of: vitamin b12: fortified nutritional yeast fortified cereals fortified soymilk meat analogues and supplements. iron: iron-fortified cereal beans tofu spinach raisins and enriched bread. zinc: cashews chickpeas oatmeal almonds beans and peas (be careful with nuts which are choking hazards) vitamin d: fortified foods (like soy milk) and supplements. the american academy of pediatrics recommends supplementation for children who don't get enough from diet. the recommended amount is 600iu. omega-3 dha: not naturally found in plant foods but can be found in some fortified foods and supplements. calcium: tofu made with calcium sulfate fortified soy milk/yogurt turnip greens kale fortified cereals a vegan diet is perfectly healthy for your son. you can get a complete diet based on the food pyramid if you are a vegan. here is how: grains - all natural forms of these products are vegan. if you buy processed foods you will need to check all the labels as some often contain animal products. be careful as some products use terminology that does not make it explicit that they are animal products. i recommend that you check an official vegan website for some of this terminology like sheffafoods veganfoods and many more you can do some online searches to find the relevant information. dairy: if you are a lacto vegan you can eat most dairy products. milk is not an animal so you might be okay with this. you will need b12 supplement if you are pure vegan; it is supplied in soy milk. drink it daily if you are pure vegan. if you ask me animal protein can't be replaced by anything else! so i would say that a vegan diet would not be a good idea especially for a 3-year child!

1645,how can i improve my denture bite? some of my favorite foods are really hard to eat now.,wearing and functioning with dentures can be very difficult. i would strongly recommend consulting with a dentist about adding a few implants to the equation. dental implants are an unbelievable innovation that stabilizes and anchors the dentures. the problem could also be that your bite and the shape of the teeth just need to be altered slightly. so see the dentist that fabricated your dentures.

3251,if poison ivy isnt contagious why is mine spreading on my body? does it go through the blood stream?,poison oak and ivy may seem to spread but it does not. it is not contagious nor does it spread through the blood. the amount of oil on the skin from the plant (the oleoresin) determines what breaks out first -- the more oil the worse the reaction. a small amount of oil may take a day or two to react (like spreading the oil to your face by taking off a t-shirt) can occur days after the first outbreak on an arm or leg. poison oak and ivy can spread from objects that are contaminated with the oils. for instance if you had the oil on your shoes and someone picked up your shoes they could get it that way.
26746,my 9 y/o boy was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (ipah) what do you recommend?,in my opinion you need to start treatment early before right ventricular hypertrophy occur low salt and low liquids early drug treatment to prevent complications many possible drugs can be used like nitric oxide prostanoid(do not recommed this one) or remodulin u should consult your doctor in which drugs will be usedalso a shunt can be done to reduce pressure (very good i would go with it if your doctor suggests it )good luck

11547,what can be done to prevent hpv transmission to my partner? what are the risks if he is infected? . hello . i found out i have hpv from an abnormal pap smear. however i do not have genital warts or any external symptoms. i am currently in a monogamous relationship with a man. i was wondering what type of precautions should be taken to prevent spreading the disease to him and what are the risks if the disease is transmitted to him? i know it slightly increases the risks of some cancers in men but is there anything else to be concerned about? . thank you,first i'm sorry to hear you have been diagnosed with human papillomavirus (hpv) but i'm glad to hear you're getting regular pap smears. unfortunately your partner may already be infected. even without external genital warts or other symptoms you can spread the virus through mere contact during sexual intercourse. and use of a condom isn't necessarily protective either since a condom doesn't cover all the skin areas that may come in contact with the virus. the good news is that serious complications or cancers from hpv in heterosexual men with healthy immune systems is rare. in fact in both your cases the virus may clear up on its own over the course of a couple of years. (though this is less likely if you're passing it back and forth. ) both you and your boyfriend should be alert for signs of genital warts on his penis or scrotum. if you notice anything resembling genital warts he should try to see a doctor for a diagnosis. really the only way to diagnose hpv in men is through physical examination during an outbreak of the warts. if you have additional questions about this don't hesitate to ask your gynecologist. hpv is incredibly common. it's estimated that up to 50% of sexually active men and women will contract hpv at some point in their lives. take care!

22029,i had a fishy smell and discharge. had a pap done and was ok. can trich or vaginosis be detected? nurse said it could. in the past ive had trich and bacterial vaginosis. the nurse said it didnt smell abnormal when i had the doctor do the papsmear. she also said it would be dectected if there was trich or bacterial vaginosis. after i contacted the nurse they called and said if it was bad results i'd receive a phone call which i didnt so everything i am assuming is okay. my question is can a papsmear detect the trichomonas or vaginosis? i am scared and hoping everything fine.,hi well if its a fishy smell and your getting a cottage cheese discharge the its bv so its either meds from your doctor or over the counter meds or go the natural way with things like sea salt garlic or boric acid capsules. each one of these you can google for more info like this sea salt for bv you find lots of info for all of them. do hope this helps you. good luck
