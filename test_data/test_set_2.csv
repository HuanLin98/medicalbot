74,are viruses and bacterias live creatures?,"yes, but... bacteria are living creatures, like the rest of us. viruses are missing some parts so are not living unless they are inside another living creature. viruses that are by themselves are dormant like seeds or spores, waiting to be reactivated. in a general sense, it is fine to think of viruses as living things, but technically speaking, they are not independently living when alone."
75,"i have a dry cough, sore throat and headaches, can you please assist with giving me possible explanations for this, i am scared as well due to the corona virus?","in brief: +- covid19 (see bel) there are multiple causes of those symptoms, including covid 19, but only go for a test if,1. you have traveled to high risk countries in the last 2-4 weeks2. you have had +ve contact with a known +ve covid 19 case3. if you have a high fever with your sore throat + severe headache + dry cough.hope that helps.rgdsdr wayne korras would you like to video or text chat with me?"
76,can a cool mist vaporizer help with the corona virus since it doesn’t like humidity?,"not particularly. the facts are your nose & upper airway add humidity to the air you breathe to the point it reaches ~100% at the level of air exchange. vaporizers help loosen thicker mucus in the upper airways so you can cough it up, but it would not have any effect on the deep airways or any germs that reach them. ."

78,"i got my tdap shot? shots? when i was little, now that i am 18, should i get them again this year or when should i? (after this epidemic of course) thank you and stay safe.",booster vaccinations. you should have had a booster at 12 years and that lasts for 10 years. if your last tdap was at 6yrs then you are overdue. i agree with waiting for after the covid pandemic unless you have an injury that would require tetanus immunity. stay safe. .

85,"my mom was diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia back in late december. after a round of antibiotics, she felt much better but the xray still showed pneumonia. a round of stronger antibiotics were then given to her. she went back for a follow up xray last week and the xray now shows the pneumonia is in both lungs. the strange thing is...she has no symptoms. no coughing, no fever, nothing. could it possibly be viral? or fluid? or cancer???? btw she has never smoked in her life.","thanks for your question on healthcare magic. i can understand your concern. radiological resolution takes 2-3 weeks in pneumonia. so it is possible that patient of pneumonia is improved symptomatically but still show pneumonia on chest x ray. so in my opinion, you should should waiting for 2 weeks more. get done repeat chest x ray after 2 weeks.if chest x ray is showing pneumonia then go for ct thorax and bronchoscopy to rule out lung cancer, tuberculosis, fungal pneumonia. if xun4 ray is improving then no need to worry. hope i have solved your query. i will be happy to help you further. wishing good health to your mother. thanks."

398,"what is the advisability of exercise in the year following treatment with levofloxaxin for pneumonia? i just completed 5 days of treatment with pills after 4 or more days of iv in the hospital following gall bladder surgery. i entered the hospital with pneumonia (not knowing i had it), probably having contracted it from my brother who had it and whom i had visited several days earlier in another hospital. i am 71 years old, female; i had a non-heart damaging heart attack in 2003 and have tried to maintain a good exercise program to lessen my chances of worsening heart disease. should i resume naproxen for joint/muscle pain; had 2 doses (2 tablets twice daily) 2 days before hospitalization. did not need it the 3rd day and was hospitalized the next day. did not take it post hospitalization. do not remember if they gave it in hospital; think not. thank you.","hello welcome to hcm. i have gone through your history. you have been adequately treated for your pneumonia and i suppose you don't have any symptoms of pneumonia like cough, fast breathing, fever, breathlessness. since you have received intravenous plus 5 days of oral antibiotics, now you can resume about your exercise regime. as you say you had a non damaging heart attack, means that your heart pumping function is well preserved. so you must not have any issues with exercise. with every lung infection the lung capacity decreases by some percentage proportional to he severity of the infection. hence along with your routine exercises you must also undergo breathing exercises with incentive spirometry, inhaling deeply through one nose holding your breath and exhaling fully from the other nose, meditation and yoga. this will help you to regain some of the lost lung capacity. you should also get vaccinated with influenza and pneumonia vaccines that include common strains which cause pneumonia remember they don't protect you against all pneumonias but offer protection against common pneumonias.regarding naproxen too much of it may cause damage to your kidneys so i advice you decrease its usage and use it only when required rather than a daily basis.wishing you good health. regards"
