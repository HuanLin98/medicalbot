73,"i have been ill for 6 weeks and my gp suspected pneumonia and i was put on antibiotics. the third one has almost cleared the infection. however, i had an x-ray and it apparently showed nothing at all, although all my symptoms were in line with pneumonia and my gp had definitely heard a lot of crackles in the left lung. is it possible that i had pneumonia if the xray was clear?","thanks for your question on healthcare magic.i can understand your concern. for diagnosis of pneumonia, chest x ray need to have infiltration.with normal chest x ray, pneumonia is not possible. cough, congestion, crackles on auscultation are also seen with bronchitis. and bronchitis shows normal chest x ray too.so it is quite possible that you improve within antibiotic because antibiotics also work in bronchitis. so i don't think you are having pneumonia because your chest x ray is normal. hope i have solved your query. i will be happy to help you further. wish you good health. thanks."
74,are viruses and bacterias live creatures?,"yes, but... bacteria are living creatures, like the rest of us. viruses are missing some parts so are not living unless they are inside another living creature. viruses that are by themselves are dormant like seeds or spores, waiting to be reactivated. in a general sense, it is fine to think of viruses as living things, but technically speaking, they are not independently living when alone."
