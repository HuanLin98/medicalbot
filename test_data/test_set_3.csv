1327,do babies have kneecaps? . babies do have kneecaps – they’re softer yours.,babies do have kneecaps – they’re just softer than yours. in babies and children bones have to be strong enough to support the body but soft enough to permit continued growth. until adulthood when bones reach their final size and strength they are made of a mixture of hard bone and softer cartilage. the kneecaps are no exception. a newborn baby’s patella (kneecap) is made almost completely of cartilage. around age 3 to 5 areas of hard bone start to form in the patella in irregular patches. these islands of bone expand and grow together over years gradually fusing to form a firm kneecap around age 10-12. plenty of cartilage still remains though to allow the patella to continue to grow through adolescence. sometime in late adolescence or young adulthood the bony patches make a final expansion replacing almost all cartilage. the result is a pair of nice strong adult kneecaps.

6504,can i get an std through urine contacting an open wound? . i was helping clean out a friends car and grabbed a sticky bottle of muscle milk. i to rinse off my hand with what i thought was water but turned out to be sour urine. i had a cut on my hand from a few days before. it possible for me to contract and sti or any other form of disease this way?,most helpful answer i never heard of a case where an std was contracted from a bottle of old urine. i think you are safe even if you recently had an open wound on your hand. needless to say i assume that you wash your hands thoroughly after this exposure. as long as you are not showing any signs of a skin infection around this wound you are in the clear. urine is typically sterile (unless the person has a urinary tract infection) but i still would not want to have this old pee on my hands. you are wise to be concerned but it would not be likely you can catch any disease from this exposure. even if you did get a minor wound infection it would not be an std.
11315,if i have ulcerative should i keep a diary of and symptoms?,"doctors and dietitians encourage patients to keep a food-and-symptoms diary for several weeks.

10742,what medications and treatments are to celiac disease?,medicines usually are not needed to treat celiac disease. if you or your child has been diagnosed with this condition your doctor may recommend taking a vitamin supplement that has iron and calcium. after you or your child is on a gluten-free diet symptoms should get better within 2 or 3 weeks nutrients should be absorbed more normally and the small intestine should gradually heal. medicine is only needed if you or your child becomes seriously ill with celiac disease or if complications develop. medicines will be given only long enough to correct these problems. doctors may prescribe steroid medications to ease swelling in the intestine and to help it absorb nutrients better. but not all experts agree about the use of these medicines to treat celiac disease. some complications such as delayed growth cannot be treated with medicine. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

5156,i have morning sickness & threw up this morning and popped some kind of vessel (not blood) in my eye near my tear duct. it like an additional bump near my tear duct in the pink tissue of my eye. there slight redness in inner eye.,as you know i have no way of examining your eyes over the internet but it is not uncommon for anyone (including someone who is pregnant) to break a small blood vessel in the eye from throwing up. you may have a subconjunctival hemorrhage. these can look absolutely frightening but they are no more serious than a bruise on your knee and will resolve in a week or so. bright red at first then brownish and then back to normal. again this is really a guess since i can't see your eye so if you are worried or concerned please consult your medical provider.

2583,is it safe for my child eat their diaper? . the child is 2 years old and will be tv or doing anything and just reach back and grab pieces of his diaper and start eating them. sometimes they are big pieces and other times they are just little pieces of foam. his doctor said not to worry about it but i think there is more to it.,"put him in a jump-suit type clothing or bibbed overalls so that he cannot get at his diaper. if you notice him doing it make an immediate correction and offer him something more appropriate to eat reminding him that ""good boys do not eat their diapers. it is yucky"". don't make a big deal about it but in order to change this behavior you have to (a) catch him in the act and (b) make an appropriate behavioral correction (do not spank him! ) and (c) offer him a appropriate snack instead. periodically. when he is not munching on his diaper. give him a big hug and tell him how proud you are that he is not eating his diaper. positive reinforcement goes a long long way in changing behavior. this nasty habit will not last long."

1774,i have a history of depression and am entering menopause. i was diagnosed with major are hormones blame?,women are at greatest risk for depression around puberty post partum and around menopause statistically. . these are times when estrogen levels falter; i think serotonin and neurotrophic factors (brain growth and health chemicals) also falter. this likely conveys some risk for depression. let's face it these times are also stressful for women which raises depression risk. given the recurrence of your depression i would suggest that whatever med you take next that resolves your depression stick with it much much longer to hopefully prevent future depressions.
16948,is there a link between continually hives and sythetic thyroid medications? . i just started to get hives on my body one day. dermatologists did the removal of possible triggers and nothing helped. it has been about 3 and 1/2 yrs and i have to take antihistamine medications to keep them at bay. i also have hypothyroidism (for 15 ) and i heard synthetic medications may cause thyroid antibodies to react against the body causing the hives. has anyone seen this connection?,any medication including thyroid medications can cause an allergic reaction such as hives. the incidence of hives with thyroid medication though is very low. however there is a known association between hives and thyroid antibodies. about a quarter of patients with long term hives (chronic urticaria) have antibodies to thyroid tissue and many of these patients are found to have low thyroid levels. the patients who had the worst hives were also the ones more likely to have antibodies to thyroid tissue. hives patients can also have antibodies to other immune mediated diseases such as lupus. unfortunately treating the thyroid condition does not eliminate the hives.

7120,is pork as a meat or a white meat?,"it is considered a ""red meat"" but certain leaner cuts of pork (ie. pork tenderloin) can nutritionally match up fairly well to chicken (a ""white"" meat). so perhaps these leaner cuts of pork can be called a ""pink"" meat (just kidding). i believe the leanest pork cut is the pork tenderloin (162 calories 4 grams fat 1. 3 grams saturated fat per 4 ounces roasted) and then after that pork chop center loin lean broiled (204 calories 8. 3 grams fat 2. 4 grams saturated fat per 4 ounces)."

9085,i a high spf lotion on my face especially when going outdoors. why do i have sun spots and white freckles?,both the dark spots and the light spots are due to cumulative sun exposure over years. what you do now may help prevent the spots from getting darker and will make it so you get fewer new ones over time but they are really markers of what happened 10-20 years ago. there are excellent sun protection products that are oil free or are designed for oily skin and i would recommend looking for those in particular if your skin is oily.

12886,will interval training help more calories and more fat?,yes it will. intervals improve your aerobic fitness level significantly and when that happens you're able to do more work and burn more calories (given the same amount of time and/or distance). for instance say you can only run on the treadmill at 6 mph. in 30 minutes at that speed and if you weigh 150 pounds you'll run 3 miles and burn 300 calories (100 calories per mile for a 150-pound person). however if you're more fit and can run at 6. 5 mph then in 30 minutes you'll run 3. 25 miles and burn more calories. and as a bonus you'll burn more fat as a result of your improved fitness. keep in mind that intervals are tough and could potentially increase your appetite. if that happens drink lots of water when you do them and have a snack with carbs and protein (and a little fat is ok) 20-30 minutes before you train. energy bars or something like a bagel with peanut butter are good choices. snacking before a workout usually decreases appetite afterward. you can also experiment with a small snack after your workout.

16994,what can be done avoid the of hypothyroidism in pregnancy?,"a number of medical associations and organizations have made recommendations on screening for thyroid disease. some of the recommendations are listed below: all women who are planning a pregnancy should be considered for screening of thyroid disease. all pregnant women with a goiter (enlarged thyroid) high blood levels of thyroid antibodies a family history of thyroid disease or symptoms of hypothyroidism should be tested for hypothyroidism. in women who are borderline or sub-clinical hypothyroid and who also have positive antibodies -- which may indicate an ongoing autoimmune thyroid destruction -- therapy with low dose thyroid hormone at the onset of pregnancy may be beneficial. there is some evidence that the antibodies that may contribute to hypothyroidism can play a role in pregnancy. data suggest that selenium supplementation may be of benefit in women with high antibody levels at the time of preconception. this should be reviewed with your doctor. women who are on thyroid hormone replacement before pregnancy should also be tested to make certain that their levels are appropriate. during pregnancy the medication dose required may increase by up to 50%. increases may be required as early as in the first trimester. dosing is dynamic during pregnancy and should be closely monitored by regular blood testing. as the pregnancy progresses many women require higher doses of hormone replacement. the dosage of thyroid hormone replacement during and after pregnancy should be carefully monitored using the blood thyroid stimulating hormone (tsh) value. the laboratory ranges for normal tsh are quite wide. most clinicians like to keep women who are pregnant and on replacement in the ""hyper"" end of the normal range. this usually equates to a tsh of 2. 0. many clinicians prefer tsh in the 1. 0 range. in women with hypothyroidism before conception most go back to their pre-pregnancy dose of thyroid hormone within a few weeks to months. it must be stressed that these are only guidelines. the management of each woman's situation is considered individually after consultation with her doctor. the benefits of treatment extend not only to pregnant women with hypothyroidism but also to their children."

8606,i have a pencil size growth that has appeared at the hairline in th middle of my forehead. slightly itches tender. it has thin dark brown line around half of the area and a small dark brown center.,i'd suggest you get this looked at. chances are it's a common wart or something benign but there's always a possibility it's a skin cancer. obviously you'd want to treat that right away. no need to rush to the emergency room. i'd suggest you make an appointment with a dermatologist or your primary care provider. meanwhile try not to scratch it squeeze it or pick at it. any of that type of behavior can break open the skin and make it easy for bacteria to enter. you don't want to get a skin infection on top of this! feel free to wash or shampoo as normal. this should not cause any ill effects to the bump. be a bit careful combing or brushing your hair so you don't catch the bump on the implement and tear it off or something. hope this helps!

8333,can i get any stds my husband has performed oral on an infected partner and then perform oral sex on me?,"yes you certainly can. if for example your husband performed oral sex on a person with genital herpes and then immediately performed oral sex on you he certainly could transmit the virus to you. if your husband performed oral sex on someone with human papilloma virus ( hpv ) he could possibly also transmit that to you. even more serious stds such as hiv or syphilis could be transmitted to you via your husband. basically if your husband's mouth area was wet with the vaginal secretions of another woman and he then rubbed these secretions on your vaginal area you could get any bug contained in the other woman's vaginal secretions. if you husband washed his face and mouth area thoroughly after performing oral sex on an infected person your chances of getting an std go down but are not eliminated entirely. this is because some viruses (such as herpes) are very hard to ""wash away. "" in fact even if days or weeks had passed in between your husband performing oral sex on another woman and then performing oral sex on you he still could transmit herpes because he may have become infected himself. i wish i had better news for you. practicing safe sex and refraining from multiple sex partners is always the best bet. best to you!"

14591,what are some harmful health effects of smoking pipes and cigars?,cancer. even if you don't inhale you can get a number of different cancers from smoking pipes and cigars. people who smoke cigars regularly are four to 10 times more likely than nonsmokers to die from cancers of the mouth larynx and esophagus. oral cancer can develop anywhere the smoke touches including the lips mouth throat and tongue. people who inhale also increase their risk for cancers of the lung pancreas and bladder. lung disease. cigar and pipe smoking double the risk for the airway damage that leads to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) a lung disease that includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. smoking can also worsen existing asthma. heart disease. smoking cigars or pipes increases your likelihood of having heart disease or a stroke. cigars boost the risk of early death from coronary heart disease by 30%. teeth problems. smoking pipes or cigars wreaks havoc on your mouth contributing to gum disease stained teeth bad breath and tooth loss. one study showed that pipe and cigar smokers had an average of four missing teeth. erectile dysfunction. smokers are twice as likely to have erectile dysfunction as nonsmokers. cigars and pipes aren't just dangerous to the people who smoke them. they also give off secondhand smoke filled with toxic chemicals such as carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons. because a cigar wrapper (which is made from a tobacco leaf) is less porous than a cigarette wrapper it doesn't burn as thoroughly as a cigarette wrapper. this increases the concentration of cancer-causing substances such as ammonia tar and carbon monoxide released into the air. despite their sweet aroma water pipes are also dangerous to your health. during a typical hookah smoking session you'll inhale 100 to 200 times the volume of smoke that you'd get from a cigarette. water pipes deliver at least as much nicotine and toxins as cigarettes and put users at similar risk for cancer and other smoking-related diseases. the same advice is true for pipe and cigar smokers as for cigarette smokers: quit. if you can't kick the habit on your own get help from your doctor another health professional or a smoking cessation service (1-800-quit-now). also make sure to get regular checkups -- including mouth exams to look for signs of oral cancer -- and talk to your doctor about getting screened for lung cancer.
12775,does burning more calories than taking in have effect on weight loss? . i am participating in a weight loss program at a local gym and am a team leader. was asked by a participant why they can't get past a plateau. calorie intake is around 900 - 1100 calories have a moderate active life style and burn about 600 calories during exercise 5-6 days a week. they had good losses until recently. can routinely burning more calories than taking in have a negative impact in weight loss?,if you are overweight then there is no negative effects of this but if you are average weight person then it will surely cause some negative effects.
25434,i was diagnosed with epilepsy i’m of this diagnosis?,i would get a second opinion from a different doctor if i were you. the range of conditions that seem to come and go would suggest some brain or nuerological (central nervous system) issue – maybe an embolism that builds up and then dissipates. get referred to a brain specialist (nuerologist) get another mri. maybe try to schedule the mri when your conditions (or one of them) are at their worst if that is possible. don’t take no for an answer from your doctor insist on seeing a specialist or two.
12467,what symptoms are typical in a person who is getting rid of a cold but needs amoxicillin? i've had yellow mucous. i'm currently getting rid of a with a sore throat runny nose and now coughing with a bit of warmness in my body but with dark yellow mucous from my nose and now my throat when coughing. would it be advisable to take amoxicillin 500 mg for 7 days? i'm 24 and don't want to jeopardize my own immunity in any way but i don't want this infection to affect my lungs or potentially lead to my heart in which i've had an open heart surgery when i was very young (asd valve). thanks for your input.,i cannot blindly advise you to self-prescribe an antibiotic based solely on the color of your mucous. mucous can be yellow simply from stagnation and congestion. it does not mean that you have a bacterial infection of some sort that would respond to amoxicillin. as you may know it is not possible to accurately diagnose you over the internet based solely on your brief posting. because you are concerned and have a history of open-heart surgery rather than treat yourself it would be prudent to be properly examined and diagnosed by a medical professional.
6221,are fruit smoothies bad. i have done very well at loosing weight and feeling better and i drink fresh smoothies for breakfast that i make myself what i want to know is is there a danger to eating this the work week every morning for breakfast. i am not concerned about the weight dangers as i eat a lower calorie diet is there any bad effects of drinking these for breakfast on a regular basis.,fruit smoothies are fine with the exception of those calories which can be surprisingly high. not all smoothies are created equal you know. if you are trying to lose weight i think it would be wise to limit these as a sole breakfast option. once in a while is fine. you will lose more weight and get a bit more mileage if you ate a piece of fruit and had some protein in the morning (like an egg) and a piece of dry toast. less calories. well no. if fruits are healthy then fruit smoothies are not bad either. but watch how much you take in because too much of anything including fruit smoothies can cause health problems like diabetes. that ius when your body cannot process sugar so the food or drink will become extra body fat. at the same time it is good to excersize. so dont worry fruit smoothies are not bad for you.
23864,i am a 20 male i have been diagnosed with depression anxiety am i taking the wrong meds?,hi. sertraline is appropriate for anxiety and depression however propranolol might be eeded to be titrated. if you doubt bipolar then first of all you need to get it evaluated by a neurophysician or a psychologist and then only medication can be changed accordingly. hope this helps.

4501,can you get tattoo when you taking,sure.
14490,my husband only coughs and spits mucus during the period. is it the beginning of copd? or is having from long.,long-term smoking generally does increase the likelihood of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd). if the coughing and spitting up mucus while smoking are new symptoms it could be a signal that lung damage is occurring including the development of copd. i'd suggest your husband see a doctor about this. the coughing and spitting may or may not be related to the smoking. he will only find out by having a physical exam. keep in mind smoking damages more organs than just the lungs. smoking can have a negative impact on the heart urinary bladder colon mouth throat and many other parts of the body. quitting smoking is always the best option but i realize it can very difficult for some people to do. and some people simply don't want to quit smoking. i hope your husband goes for a physical exam to find out how his lungs and heart are doing. i wish you all the best!
4748,is there anyway i can treat chylamidia without going to the doctors office? . i went once and they treated but i don't think it was effective. just want to be able to get rid of it without having to go to the doctors all over again. can't i just buy a pill at walmart or something?,effective chlamydia treatment requires an antibiotic -- a prescription antibiotic not something you can buy on a shelf over-the-counter. if your treatment wasn't effective you will need to see your medical provider again and re-evaluate your safe sexual practices. chlamydia requires a partner who is infected so how about using condoms?

10528,why is the aca a one size all policy? why do we to pay for health services that don't pertain to us?,i wouldn't describe the aca as a one-size fits all but it does create a minimum set of benefits that all plans in the individual and small employer market must cover (note: nearly all large employer plans already cover these benefits). previously most plans in the individual market did not offer very comprehensive coverage and had a number of exclusions (e. g. maternity mental health coverage even cancer treatments). the idea behind insurance is that it is spreading risk across a large group of people. at any point in time many people will be healthy and won't need to go to the doctor.

11367,how is 1 diabetes,treatment for adults type 1 diabetes requires lifelong treatment to keep blood sugar levels within a target range. treatment includes: taking several insulin injections every day or using an insulin pump. monitoring blood sugar levels several times a day using a home blood sugar meter. eating a healthful diet that spreads carbohydrate throughout the day to prevent high blood sugar levels after meals. regular physical exercise because exercise helps the body to use insulin more efficiently. exercise may also lower your risk for heart and blood vessel disease. regular medical checkups to monitor and adjust treatment as needed. screening tests and exams need to be done regularly to watch for signs of complications such as eye kidney heart blood vessel and nerve diseases. not smoking. not drinking alcohol if the person is at risk for periods of low blood sugar. a regular daily schedule makes managing blood sugar levels easier. blood sugars are easier to predict and control when mealtimes amounts of food and exercise are similar every day. many people find out that they have type 1 diabetes when they are admitted to a hospital for diabetic ketoacidosis. if their symptoms are severe they may need to be treated in an intensive care unit. treatment for diabetic ketoacidosis includes fluids given through a vein (intravenous or iv) to treat dehydration and to balance electrolytes and insulin to lower the blood sugar level and stop the body from producing ketones. 3 treatment for children treatment for children includes all of the above measures to keep blood sugar levels within the child's target range. treatment for children should also allow for normal growth and development. see the topics type 1 diabetes: recently diagnosed and type 1 diabetes: children living with the disease. when a small child has diabetes the parents have the responsibility for blood sugar control. as the child grows he or she can take more responsibility for diabetes care. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

639,does exercise interfere with muscle gains weightlifting?,your body prefers not to use amino acids the building blocks of muscle as an energy source unless it has to because it’s simply not the most efficient way for your body to get the energy it needs. your body will typically use the more efficient means of attaining energy first. weight lifting and aerobic exercise can complement each other well but if you have concerns with not being able to gain muscle mass keep the aerobic exercise at a moderate amount. it might be best to refrain from doing overly excessive endurance aerobic events. try doing high intensity interval training. interval training involves coupling short bursts of high intensity exercise with less intense recovery periods. for example you could run on a treadmill for 1 minute at 8mph and then jog for 30 seconds at 6mph repeating for a total of 10 to 15 minutes. this is just an example to illustrate the point; you can do different intensity levels and different work to rest ratios. consider also doing circuit training which is a workout regimen involving resistance training with very little rest in between exercise sets. this form of exercise is high intensity and helps keep your heart rate elevated so that it can function as aerobic exercise while providing a foundation for muscular strength and endurance. lastly make sure that you are getting enough protein in your diet. the essential amino acids necessary for muscular growth and development can only be obtained through dietary intake. if you’re not getting enough protein you won’t be building muscle regardless of your activity. if you're training for an endurance event like a marathon when you might run 60 miles or more per week you'll almost always see a decrease in your muscle mass. for most of us who do more moderate amounts of physical activity there will be minimal if any loss in muscle mass from aerobic exercise -- so there's nothing to worry about. if you do plan on lots of aerobic exercise and are concerned about losing muscle try starting with 20-30 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise (at 50% to 70% of your maximum heart rate) two to three days per week and see how it goes.

165,does biotin help reduce lactic acid build up. i started kick boxing doing a lot more activity an effort to get back into shape. i was told biotin would help break down the lactic acid build up in my muscles,although biotin does play a role in amino acid metabolism there are no studies (that i can find) that show taking biotin decreases lactic acid production. if someone is deficient in biotin it could limit performance or muscle formation but that is unlikely. if you are getting enough through diet you probably don't need to supplement. for more on lactic acid and biotin see these articles: exercise and lactic acidosis biotin supplement guide

6933,i take bupropion and i want to nyquil for cold. is that safe?,you can take nyquil occasionally for a cold while taking bupropion. there are no dangerous drug interactions between the two medications. i am answering based off of research i just did on drug interactions because of my own after effects. nyquil inhibits the liver enzyme that breaks down dextromethorphan. which means that this cough suppressant stays in your system for a long period of time. personally i am finding it unpleasant and consider myself illegal to drive. if nyquil as no effect on your sleepiness or balance you may be ok. i am basically dizzy for a prolonged period. bah i even proof read and missed it. *bupropion* inhibits the enzyme that breaks down the cough suppressant. only correction needed on my above statement.
21655,what is the way to rid yourself of nasty little,1) throw what items can be thrown away. 2)bag linens and clothing in plastic bags and place in sun. high heat will suffocate them like dryer hair dryer (120°f/48. 8ºc minimum) 3) depending how bad you have them vacuum are and empty bag outside of home in garbage. 4)alternatively place a bed bug proof mattress cover over an infested mattress to trap the bed bugs inside and starve them to death. this will eliminate the need to purchase a new mattress/boxspring 5) spray bed bugs with rubbing alcohol. this kills them on the spot. use the rubbing alcohol and a dish brush to kill the visible eggs then call an exterminator. 6) bedbugs also succumb to cold temperatures below freezing but the chilling period must be maintained for at least two weeks. attempts to rid an entire home or apartment of bed bugs by raising or lowering the thermostat will be entirely unsuccessful.

18855,how can identify food allergies our baby might have?,it’s important to introduce baby to new foods gradually and one at a time in case of food allergies. otherwise you’ll have trouble tying an allergy to a specific new food. for example if you give your baby three new foods over the course of a day and she develops an allergic reaction you won’t know which of the foods provoked it. it doesn’t matter all that much which foods you introduce to your baby or which order you introduce them in as long as the foods you are offering are healthy and well-balanced. but each time you offer a new food you should wait three to five days before adding another to the menu. don’t eliminate all the other foods your baby is already eating during that time -- just don’t add anything else new.
770,are eating carrots bad for people who are at-risk for macular degeneration? . my eye doctors have told me that i should stay away from eating carrots since there is a long history of macular degeneration in my family. almost everyone on my mothers side has one kind or the other. is there any truth that eating carrots could be bad for you? i like to eat carrots but i am not a nut about eating them. i may have a several small ones with now and again but that's it. thanks for your time,this is not something i've heard before and is not a typical diet recommendation. a variety of fruits and veggies are encouraged to help prevent macular degeneration especially leafy greens like spinach due to their high lutein content. at your next visit i suggest asking your eye doctors why they recommend no carrots so you can better understand the reasoning behind it. good luck!

4411,when should wean my baby his binkie?,"binkies do not cause dental problems in infants or toddlers so you do not have to worry about this. likewise binkies may reuce the incidence of sids (crib death). i do not think you need to take it away though your son will get used to whatever. some parents prefer to encourage thumb-sucking since the thumb is always ""handy"" (sorry -- bad pun). bottom line: make a decision and go with it. if you want to terminate the binkie know that there may be a few rough nights but your son will adjust. if you want to continue to support it then just do so knowing that there will be no long-term benefits (if it is stopped by age 5) and that there may also be some benefit."
7697,i fell on cement stairs 6 ago and still in pain. i don’t like taking drugs to mask the pain. what i do?,"i would like to know if you went to see a doctor or health care provider when you fell and if you are still seeing them. it is very important that you advise them that you are still in pain so they can re-evaluate your condition and possibly prescribe treatment. at the end of the day your quality of life is the most important and if you are on the right medications it will actually help. when pain is not treated properly it can cause other issues like insomnia and depression not to mention the fact that you may call out sick from work or not be able to focus on work -- something that is called ""presenteeism.

8983,in a healthy adult is the inner ear temperature different from the oral temperature? . in a healthy adult is the inner temperature different the oral temperature?,"as a matter of fact temperature measured orally does differ from temperature measured in the ear. in fact there are several different ways to measure temperature and they all provide slightly different readings. generally an ear (or ""tympanic membrane"") temperature reads slightly higher than an oral temperature. an armpit temperature is slightly lower than an oral temperature. it's important to note there isn't really an exact norm for adult body temperature. your oral temperature usually can be several degrees cooler than 98. 6 and around 1 degree higher yet still be considered in the ""normal"" range. hope this helps!"

2998,do you recommend to help tighten the vagina? have a new baby & my husband said it doesn't feel the same. . other than kegels,kegels are the best so keep at it. your husband needs to be a bit more sympathetic and patient to a woman that just passed a baby through that passageway. with a new baby you have more things on your mind right now than worrying about tightening your vagina. over time things will return to normal and there is really little that can be done other than the kegels. maybe he can do some penis exercises to increase his girth? i heard that helping with dishes housework laundry grocery shopping etc. will help. you will be back to normal in about a month. don't worry about it. i will admit that it feels pretty strange if you haven't experienced it. way too soft and loose. and i'm not a little guy either. however i am the father of nine and my wife's inards are just as wonderful as they ever were. and that's after more than thirty years. i like the advice the dr. gave. tell your husband to chill. maybe be should read more often;especially now that he is a father.

20514,can i get pregnant from precum ovulating? . i'm having some symptoms but haven't missed my period which should start tomorrow. having cramps achy boobs increased mucous tightness round the lower part of my stomach some nausea. i've been tracking my cycle n its predictable now so i usually just have cramps n that's it. me n my friend always use the pull out method but this time i was ovulating n i feel odd with all these symptoms.,hi here's a bit of info i found its interesting being it's about re-cum. can i get pregnant from pre-cum? pre-cum or pre-ejaculatory fluid to call it by it's correct name is a clear fluid that appears on the tip of the penis when a man has an erection and is sufficiently sexually excited. it is a common misconception that this fluid is semen that has leaked out before the main ejaculation. this is incorrect because this fluid is produced by something called the cowper gland and it's purpose is to flush out the penis before ejaculation. so can you get pregnant from pre-ejaculatory fluid (pre-cum)? well. as this fluid does not contain sperm it can't by itself cause a pregnancy. however as the purpose of this fluid is to flush out the penis it will bring any sperm left in the penis from the last ejaculation to the tip of the penis. if this happens that small amount of sperm could cause a pregnancy. if the man has urinated since his last ejaculation the urine would have flushed out and killed any left over sperm in the penis which means in this case a pregnancy wouldn't happen. the safest thing is to assume that an erect penis is always capable of causing a pregnancy even before an ejaculation so cover it with a condom before it comes in contact with the vagina. good luck
8622,very painfull headache. droppy right eyelid next morning & been 3 days still droppy. temporary or permanent & options? . a few days ago had the worst headache of my life. next day i woke up my right eye was far more ''sleepy'' then my left eye & it opened later but was still little ''droppy''. . did a little research & concluded that its ptosis. now my question is whether is this thing permanent or temporary. what are my options,"you should seek medical attention. you're correct that the medical term for a droopy eyelid is ""ptosis "" but what concerns me here is what caused the ptosis. you describe the symptoms of a possible stroke. you need to have that evaluated soon. because it's been three days now you probably don't need to go to the emergency room unless you develop new stroke symptoms such as: another severe headache weakness on one side of the body trouble speaking coherently sudden confusion but do make an appointment with your primary care provider as soon as possible. when you call tell the receptionist you think you might have had a stroke several days ago. that should help get you in to see the doctor more quickly. i wish you all the best!"
1850,please help! sitting blood pressure 185/109 and standing bp 117/93. my husband is on several bp meds incl. clonodine. his bp runs 210/115 to 175/100. he excercises regularly and his bp goes down for a while after. recently we noticed that his bp is lower when taken standing vs. sitting. it spikes during the night always. he had a 5 way bypass at 50 years old because his bp never controlled. what can we do? please help! we need a dr. house to figure out what is wrong with him and why medication is not working. thank you.,"your husband clearly has uncontrolled hypertension that needs hands-on medical intervention. blood pressure can be successfully treated but it may take a different medication. it is imperative that you consult an internist/cardiologist so that he can be properly managed. there are some identifiable causes for high blood pressures but most are considered ""idiopathic"" or essential hypertension. which means there is no specific one cause but rather a plethora of medical issues that may be contributory."
8139,pain in upper right quadrant of abdomen may what. year old grand daughter had gallbladder stmptoms but no stones doctor said bile was crystalizing and bladder was removed. still having problems. food test showed food slow at passing from stomach to intestines. smaller portions have not helped. couple crackers may induce vomiting. what are possible causes?,i'm sorry to hear your granddaughter's going through this especially at such a young age. i'm obviously not a doctor but the first thing that comes to my mind when you describe your granddaughter's symptoms is gastroparesis. in this condition a person's stomach does not empty as quickly as it's supposed to. even though gastroparesis is not common i've known several people with the condition. all of them said they experienced pain in the upper-right quadrant and all of them were frustrated that physicians told them pain is not a symptom of gastroparesis. in my opinion gastroparesis is not well-understood by most physicians. if your granddaughter ultimately is diagnosed with this condition i suggest you find a specialist to help her. she will need someone with deep knowledge of this unusual condition in order to help her learn how to meet her nutritional needs with a stomach that chronically malfunctions. note i'm not attempting to diagnose your granddaughter with gastroparesis. i'm only saying this is one possibility of what's going on based on the information you provided. it may be worth checking into this possibility more -- or at least getting it ruled out. wishing you (and your granddaughter) well! you might check for shingles. i know you are only 18 but i know several young people that have had it. in some cases you have the pain before you see any rash or blisters. i was one of those which made it hard to diagnose. others have the rash or blisters then the pain. it's something to check out. your pain is in the same area my was and it lasted for like a month.

7685,what the drug capadex used for and what are the side,capadex is the newest addition to the proton pump inhibitor family. it actually works and sits in your stomach and has a special mechanism that it's delayed as it releases. so therefore the drug stays around longer in your system. it is actually used for treating of ulcers as well as gerd. one of the things is that the side effects would be very similar to the class effects with other ppis. so constipation diarrhea nausea dizziness. i do encourage patients though to see how they are feeling as they are taking this new medication encourage them to keep a diary of their symptoms to see if it's helping. we are finding out that patients basically on medications react differently to different ones and your therapy may have to be individualized. so after a month and you are not feeling so well you come to the pharmacist we find that out we may refer you back to your physician. because that might not be the right choice you may have to be put on a different type of medication that might work a little better. but tracking your symptoms letting us know how you feel is probably one of the most important things.

2106,is it possible ingrown toenail to heal itself? or could it have been something else? . for about a month my toe was ingrown. the skin was pushed out an inch and broke on occasion causing light bleeding. a week ago it started to heal back and is now mostly back to where it should be. the wound has scabbed over and there is no longer pain to the touch. there was never any sign of infection but i didn't take any of the in home steps to heal it. did i just get lucky or is it likely something else? the same toe on my other foot looks like going to do the same thing soon.,yes as the nail grows an ingrown toenail can heal itself. sometimes. so yes you were fortunate that this happened to you. most ingrown nails are caused by improper nail trimming. the toenails should not be trimmed round like the fingernails. toenails should be trimmed more or less square avoiding cutting them too deep on the sides. unlike the hands feet are stuffed into shoes most of the day and this compression also tends to be problematic for some people. make sure your shoes fit well and stop digging at your toenails when you trim them!
