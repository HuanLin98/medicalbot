0,I am suffering from allergy over 5 years. I have chronic sneeze every morning. I often have running nose all day and it causes headache. It ceases me from work. Please help.,"As you said you suffer from nasal allergy and you have frequent running nose and sneezing, it is very clear that you are suffering from allergic rhinitis.Now, next thing in management is to find out the trigger factor of frequent attacks of sneezing. So, most commonly it is dust, pollen, mites, fumes or any strong chemical fragrance in your surrounding. We call it as a trigger for your allergic symptoms.If you can find the trigger, you should try to avoid exposure to it as much as possible. This will help in reducing the attacks in most instances.As allergic rhinitis is a chronic condition, we can only control the symptom but cannot cure it permanently. There is no cure for any allergy.In case you are not able to find out the trigger, you should do a skin allergy test or blood allergy test and check for environmental panel of allergy as in most cases we find the cause is external environment only. If not we can consider other allergy panels like food items, some drugs or other triggers.So, after an allergy test you are pretty sure about what is causing frequent attacks of allergy."
1,"I am a 45 year old female. I have chronic allergies, which become worse in winter. What can I do, so that I do not need to take anti-allergic medications?","The allergic symptoms usually aggravate during winter season. It continues from November till February based on the climate in your place.You have not mentioned about the allergic site (nose or lung or skin). If it is nose or lung, the dryness due to winter can trigger the allergic response in nose. In this situation, you need to maintain moisture by just applying a drop of coconut oil in each nostril before going to bed.On the other hand, you can apply a drop of Anu Thailam (an ayurvedic nasal drops for allergy) in each nostril before going to bed.During evenings and nights, when it is too cold, you need to protect your ears (by keeping cotton plug), nose (by applying oil drops), head (by covering head with a woolen cap) and hands and feet (by wearing gloves and socks). The external cold stimulus triggers the allergic response. So, prevent yourself from the cold stimulus to avoid allergy.If you have allergic asthma, then it is better to practice pranayama and yoga. Breathing exercises will help you.If you have allergic skin disorder, then you can use vaseline or vegetable oils to gently apply on the skin. This helps in overcoming the dryness due to the cold climate. The skin manifestation should also be examined by a physician to decide the proper medication."
3,"I had a�head injury�last week. I started doing normal activities after five days, but now I have�a�constant headache. I have an exam later this month. What should I do?","The presence of a headache after head injury is present in 20 to 30 % of individuals, but most often it is related to stress and other factors rather than the head injury itself. The possibility of stress causing this sort of a headache is high as you have an exam later this month.I mean to say that, stress management is key for you to tackle this persistent headache. In case the headache remains persistent, an option of low dose TCA (tricyclic antidepressants) such as Amitriptyline 10 mg at bedtime, which can be used after talking to your doctor. I need to emphasize here that a persistent headache is unlikely to respond to simple painkillers, as we need to control the causative factors."
4,"I have�left-sided headaches�from the last five�days. I notice it more when I chew food. I have anxiety problems since last two years, for which I take Petril�0.25 daily. Please help me. How to get rid of these headaches?","From the available description, it is possible that there is a problem in your left temporomandibular joint, which causes pain during chewing. The second possibility for these headaches is anxiety itself.The presence of unilateral headaches also points toward a migraine. Although, the possibility is low because the pain increases on chewing. I suggest you try consulting a dentist to rule out any abnormality of the TMJ joint. Hopefully, he or she will find the cause of these headaches.In case there is an insufficient response from the dental specialist, get a CT scan of the brain and report back to me."
5,"I am 44-years-old female, and I am suffering from hypertension. My blood pressure is 135/84 mmHg today. I am taking the medications regularly but cannot bring my blood pressure under control. I have headaches and dizziness often.","I understand you have hypertension.You are still recording mild hypertension, despite taking your medicines regularly.I want to know if you have tested for kidney, thyroid, adrenal, and electrolyte imbalance. Salt restricted diet and exercise will help you with further control of the mildly elevated blood pressure.If you have a home blood pressure monitor, you can record your blood pressure twice in the morning and evening (two morning and evening readings to be done in sitting posture with one-minute interval). This can be done thrice a week, and average blood pressure is thus known. I do not want to change or increase hypertension medicines based on one reading you provided.I hope I have answered your query."
6,"I am a 30 year�old male, who is suffering from�chronic migraines. Occasional�marijuana�seems to have helped. But, I test positive for drug tests. What do I do?","Marijuana will initially help you, but in the long run, it will have side effects, so try to leave the habit.�As you have chronic migraines, there are chances that you may get an�attack of a�headache once in a while, because�migraines can be avoided�with the help of medications, but cannot be completely cured."
7,"For the last three days, I have noticed�blood in the stools. It is not noticeable at first until the stool starts to separate. It is not thick mucousy, but it is red and mimics blood. I do not have any pain or strain.","Blood in stool, always calls for a detailed evaluation.Basic investigations, including stool examination, is necessary to confirm it is actually blood and nothing else.Next, blood investigations are to be done to find out its correlation.The most important step is to identify the source and site of blood loss.Fresh blood in stool without pain is usually due to lower intestinal bleed. It is difficult to comment on the diagnosis without supporting investigations. Once the investigations are done, kindly upload the reports, and I will suggest accordingly."
8,"I recently had a high fever, cough, and body pain. I suffered from COVID during the seventh month of pregnancy and had a C-section delivery before three months. And my CBC reports showed the platelets value as 520000 cells/mcL. After one week, it came back to 490000 cells/mcL.","According to your statement, you have been suffering from elevated platelet count, fever, body ache, and cough. High platelet count is known as thrombocytosis that may result from blood loss due to acute bleeding. The bleeding may be due to the presence of any infections, iron deficiency anemia, hemolytic anemia, inflammatory disorders like rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, inflammatory bowel disease, surgery, trauma, carcinoma, etc.According to the blood reports, you may suffer from anemia due to iron deficiency as your hemoglobin levels are below the normal range (attachments removed to protect the patient�s identity). So, your previous history of C-section, urinary tract infections, or anemia might be the reason for elevated platelet count."
9,"My blood pressure is high. Can I reduce my blood pressure from 146/95 mmHg to normal, just with regular exercises? I started working out at the gym for an hour, both in the mornings as well as in the evenings, since the last two days. Do I still need to continue my medications?","I observe that your BMI (body mass index) is 28, which means you comes under BMI category overweight.Reducing your weight as well as getting your BMI to around 20 will directly help reduce your blood pressure.Also, check if you have a snoring problem. You could be having sleep apnea, which is a reversible cause of high blood pressure.I suggest you do some aerobic exercises rather than lift weights."
10,"I am a 26 year old female. My weight is about 310 to 315 lbs. My height is 5'7"". I am in need to know if I am crazy or need to go to the ER. I have for some time now been having these sorts of attacks. I could not breathe, feel extremely hot and break in sweats. My chest is tight. My eyes get blurry. I feel like losing control of myself. For some reason, my left arm feels so weird, numb and tingling with lots of pressure.","Lifestyle modification will suit you better like meditation, yoga, aerobics, zumba, and breathing exercise."
11,"I am 30 years old. I want to reduce my belly fat. Actually, I do not have time for exercise. I sleep at 4.30 AM and wake up at 11 PM. Can you help me to reduce my fat?","Is it work that makes you sleep so late? This is one of the factors that needs change. The other thing is that you need to exercise and eat regularly. You need to burn 3000 Kcal daily, and to do that, you will need to exercise for 45 to 60 minutes daily with a combination of aerobic and weight training. You need to eat 1500-2000 Kcal daily and drink plenty of water and keep your vitamin D levels normal. In addition, check your thyroid function too. Finally, melatonin (your sleep hormone) may be disrupted due to poor sleep patterns, and that needs to be corrected."
12,"I am a 16-year-old male, and my height is 5.4 feet. How to increase my height?","After you attain puberty, the body's long bones stop growing further as their growing ends fuse with the bone. These bones then reach a permanent size. There are many pills, injections,etc., available through the internet, which claims to increase your height. Their effect is doubtful, and do not waste your time, energy, and money on them. Regular yoga practice is known to help in the improvement of the posture and ease tension in the body, which, in turn, can help make a person feel taller. Several yoga positions can help to maximize these effects. Your height depends on your age and, in some cases, your average family height. Drinking milk, stretching, and proper sleep can increase your height as the secretion of growth hormone increases during sleep, especially in the early morning hours. To produce extra growth hormones, develop a significant grow taller exercise program. Scientific studies have shown that the brain releases a larger quantity of growth hormone after aerobic exercises. I hope this information has been both informative and helpful for you."
13,"From the past two months, I am underweight loss program for self by practicing yoga and aerobics at home for almost 1.5 hours and I have reduced 5 kg and superb inch loss. However, from the past two weeks, my weight is constant at 90 kg. Hence, I was curious to know the reason. I am having a good inch loss but no weight reduction. Please help me by connecting me to a good fitness specialist/doctor who could help me in answering my query.","This is now very uncommon that the person continues to have inch loss, but the weight remains static.Various reasons are as follows:1) Initial weight loss is mainly water weight and body has to maintain a certain percentage to be able to survive. This accounts for initial weight loss but then water cannot be lost indefinitely.2) The most sustained weight loss attained by (regular exercise and yoga) in your case is the fat loss add this is slow and sustained and this is still happening.3) With regular exercise, muscle mass increases which counterbalances the water and fat weight loss.This is called the stalling phase and unless one understands these people feel frustrated and may even give up. Weight loss of 1 pound per week is a good go and you are spot on."
14,"I am a type 1 diabetic and have been injecting insulin every day for years already. With this current quarantine going on, I gained some weight which made me worry. Although my BMI says that I am on the normal side, it still made me upset because the belly, arms, and legs have gotten bigger. So I started doing minimal resistance training and changed my eating habits for three weeks already. I noticed that my legs look leaner but my upper body is still the same. This made me anxious because it might have something to do with my insulin medications and I cannot go to an actual dietician since they were still on quarantine so I thought someone might be able to help me online. I am hoping to hear from you. This would really be a big help to my overall health for the rest of my life.","Yes, insulin might result in some weight gain, but if you are keeping a check on your calories and include a good amount of non-starchy food including whole grain, fresh whole fruits, and vegetables will help you to shed some fat.Keep a check on your exercise minutes, you can easily do 150 minutes of aerobic exercise per week which includes walking, bicycling, and other forms of moderate muscle strengthening exercises.Just keep in mind that your sugar level must not go down, do not reduce your insulin dosage. Also never skip a meal, if you skip a meal you will tend to indulge more calories in the next meal. Include more protein rich food, protein, and fiber rich meals will bring early satiety and will easily help build in more muscles than fat."
15,"Please take a look at my case of�skin dryness and flaking�on my face. This is a�cyclic condition�which occurs almost every 7-8 months. The dryness persists for 1-2 months during which I also have general body itching over hands, legs and under my ribs on the sides. The strange thing is that after 1-2 months this dryness�spreads to scalp�followed by heavy dandruff and very heavy hair loss. This time the dryness and flaking is very extreme.","It is a crystal clear case of seborrheic dermatitis and is moderate in nature.It is a fungal infection and is very chronic in nature. Like diabetes, it can only be controlled and cannot be cured permanently as the fungus causing it is a normal resident of skin. Whenever the condition becomes suitable for it, it proliferates.The good news is that it is harmless. Diabetes can also cause severe seborrheic dermatitis, because increased sugar gives fungus a suitable environment to proliferate.As I said already that it is a chronic condition, follow up is very necessary. Currently, I will give you medicines for a month. Make sure to review your condition after a month as the dose and course would be decided accordingly."
16,"I have�itchy boils on the scrotum and groin areas. During the day, I feel too itchy, and due to the itching, I have developed rashes which are painful. When I try to break them, it starts to bleed. Sometimes, I have the itchiness during the night as well. I have attached an image for your consideration.","It does look like a fungal infection. Due to the application of steroid-based products, the clinical picture has been altered. The use of a steroid-based product for a fungal infection aggravates it.Few of those nodules which appear raised can be molluscum contagiosum, a viral infection. But, clinical examination is necessary for conclusive diagnosis."
17,I am a 23-year-old male. My hands remain dry always. And I could notice red spots on the back of my left hand during bedtime. These spots last for about 30 minutes to one hour. They are not itchy or painful. I am having this issue for more than seven years. I am allergic to dust and mites. Is my problem because of an allergy?,"Your skin problem is allergic contact dermatitis. It is advisable to apply moisturizer immediately after washing your hands to avoid its recurrence. And also, apply Halobetasol cream twice daily over the affected area.This kind of dermatitis will worsen with time because the allergy cells that create such a reaction get potent day by day. The only way to prevent them is to avoid the allergen, and apply moisturizers to prevent the direct penetrations of allergens into the skin can be largely avoided."
18,"I have had diarrhea from the evening, and my stomach feels bloated. It does not smell good. I am taking electrolytes and do not eat anything. I started taking medications for my high BP three weeks ago. What should I do now? Shall I eat a banana?","I understand that you have acute gastroenteritis. It may be due to food poisoning or a viral infection. I suggest you do a COVID-19 test (Coronavirus Disease-2019). Kindly monitor your temperature as your increased heart rate may be due to a fever. It is an excellent thing that you are taking electrolytes. It would be best to take 200 ml of electrolytes at a time. And if you have a fever, add Paracetamol or Acetaminophen. Taking probiotics and antacids like Pantoprazole will also be helpful.Keep yourself well hydrated. If diarrhea persists, there are gut antibiotics like Rifaximin, which will help you to get better. Meanwhile, avoid milk and fried food."
19,"I am in my early 60s. For the last three months,�after dinner, I feel indigestion for 2 hours and have a crampy stomach with lots of belchings. Because of this, I am not on regular food. Earlier, I had a few issues, but that was manageable and not so intense. Now, even when not taking food, I get belching and wake up in the middle of night.","Having normal endoscopy reports does not eliminate other small intestine related causes for indigestion.Constipation itself cause heartburn and belching related to incomplete evacuation due to slow intestinal movement. The treatment of constipation correct this problem.Sometimes inflammation in the small intestine due to irritation or food allergy to a particular food can cause indigestion related symptoms and occasionally diarrhea. Neither colonoscopy nor upper GI endoscopy able to access the small intestine.Having the habit of smoking since a long time and the symptoms of belching with occasional diarrhea may require to rule out pancreatitis, and thus you might require CT scan of the abdomen with contrast.To relieve symptoms, you can take intestinal digestive enzyme supplements (to promote digestion) and antispasmodic medication (to control pain).It is recommended to undergo further tests to identify the cause of these symptoms and so appropriate treatment can be started."
20,"I have been having problems walking with lightheadedness. It has affected my mental health, and I have been to every doctor. Some are saying it is vertigo, while others say it is blood pressure. But no tablets have helped. My current symptoms are dizziness, nausea, migraines, swaying sensation, loss of appetite, and loose bowels. I really would love an opinion as I want my life back and struggling a lot.","Suppose you have already undergone all the MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) of the brain and videonystagmography. And if they are found to be expected, then there are only a few possibilities that need to be ruled out. They are as follows;1) Vestibular migraine: It is the most common condition causing imbalance, nausea, headaches, and various other symptoms, which can be treated very easily.2) PPPD (Persistent postural perception dizziness): It is mainly a functional condition related to a phobia disorder. This condition requires detailed evaluation by an ENT specialist and a psychiatrist. Treatment involves counseling and medicines."
21,"I have been feeling an ear blocking sensation for the past two weeks. I also have a slight loss of hearing at times in my right ear. Although it is mostly in my right ear, sometimes the sensation alternates to my left. It feels as though the sound is not coming through. It is an odd sensation to describe. I have had a doctor check me out, and they did not see any damage or signs of infection, but they are not specialists, so I am not sure what could be causing this or how to treat it if possible. Also, I have been experiencing slight dizziness or heaviness and pain in the back of my head. Thank you.","The symptoms described by you match with otitis media with effusion of the said ear. In this problem, mucus accumulates behind the eardrum causing some loss of hearing, fullness, and mild dizziness. It follows after an attack of nose block and throat pain.When we examine the ear using an otoscope, we can see a small bulge with a loss of shininess of the drum. An audiogram shows conductive loss of hearing. A tympanometry shows B type of curve.The treatment for the same requires you take a course of antibiotics, some decongestants, some nasal drops, and anti-inflammatory medicines for five days. Subsequently, you need a mucolytic agent for a week to lighten the mucus and bring it down.It should resolve completely in about a week or two. If you need more details do revert. I will be happy to help you."
22,"She is getting episodes of dizziness from the last one and a half or two years. Most of the time, they are mild, and they occur for few seconds when she gets up or sits down. Sometimes, they stay long and are associated with nausea and other symptoms. And few months, she does not have any symptoms. She does not have any other complaints like headaches or muscle weakness, and she does not have diabetes or hypertension. But, she gets migraines from the last 15 years, for which, she takes Melzap 0.25 mg. She also takes Vertin 16 mg for insomnia and anxiety. These medicines reduce her episodes, but they do not stop them completely. What could be the reason for it? Is it something to worry about?","No, it is not something to worry about. Her symptoms and response to Vertin (Betahistine), although incomplete, suggests that these are originating from the internal ear, which is the most common cause of dizziness in old age.This occurs due to age-related changes leading to abnormalities in balancing system of the ear. Also, recurrent viral infection of the ear aggravates these and precipitates the episodes, and it is called as labyrinthitis.However, we should rule out other causes in old age like postural hypotension, and slow heart rate called as bradycardia. So, if you have a blood pressure apparatus, you could check her BP at home.You should measure her BP and pulse rate at rest in lying down position, then make her stand for three minutes, then measure again either at the end of the three minutes or the beginning of dizziness if it occurs before the end of three minutes. Drop of blood pressure more than 15 to 20 is significant.The treatment is mostly done with medicine like Vertin 16 mg up to three times. If the patient is not responding, then tablet Vertigon (Cinnarizine) 25 mg up to three times a day can be tried. Also, an ENT specialist will teach exercises for this, which can be done at home."
23,"My father has had an infection between his toes for the last 20 days. He has diabetes. His fasting blood sugar is 190 mg/dL, and his post-prandial blood sugar is 320 mg/dL. We took a doppler test for his infection, and it came back normal. For the last week, we are using Sertaconazole, but it did not help. His kidney and liver functions are also normal. He is using Zoryl M2 tablets for diabetes.","I suggest that he apply Mupirocin ointment twice daily for 15 days and take tablet Roxid 150 mg (Roxithromycin) twice daily after food for five days. Clean the lesion with Povidone iodine and cotton, kindly keep the area clean and dry and avoid scratching and rubbing the lesion."
24,"I am a 41 year old female, and I suffer from a lot of diseases. I gave birth five years back, and at that time, the doctor told me that I have diabetes. My blood sugar level is high even after delivery, and I also have vitamin D deficiency. Currently, I take 80 units of Insulin daily, and I take approximately 16 to 18 tablets daily. Now, I started having pain in my foot, which is unbearable. I am frustrated with taking medicines. Can ayurvedic medicines relieve all my health issues?","As you have multiple health issues, it will take some time to resolve. Some may be cured completely, like vitamin D deficiency and foot pain, but diabetes can only be controlled, and with the help of ayurvedic medicine you can prevent further side effects of diabetes on other organs as diabetes affects kidneys, heart, eyes, etc.About the foot pain, you did not mention about the cause and the medicines that you are taking. The cause can be injury, arthritis, pain due to deficiency of calcium and vitamin D or due to the weakness of nerves due to diabetes.The specific treatment requires the cause, so if you have performed any blood tests for arthritis let me know. If not, then do perform the tests."
25,"I have been sick for over a month. It started with a sore throat, chest tightness and followed by bronchitis. Now I have stuffy nose and fever. I have taken bronchitis medications (Methylprednisolone, Amoxicillin and BREO inhaler). I have used a nebulizer with Albuterol. I am taking vitamin D 50,000 units because my vitamin D count was low. What is wrong with me?","You might be having chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with superadded lower respiratory tract infection.In my opinion, you can taper and stop Methylprednisolone as it is a steroid and it further reduces the immunity resulting in infections.Get a chest x-ray and complete blood count done as your problems are persistent since one month. You may need antibiotics depending on the reports.Consult a physician after the x-ray and complete blood count is done. Stop smoking if you are used to it. Also, check sputum examination for grams and AFB (acid fast bacilli) stain if you are coughing out sputum.For further advice consult a general medicine physician online --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/general-medicine-physician"
26,"On Thursday, I woke up with sharp pain under my left rib. It came and went throughout the day. In the night, I got up and had stabbing pain in the chest, then was mostly fine on Friday until bedtime. I got in bed going to sleep and had pain under my left rib again and heart flutter (not sure if this was then a panic attack) this morning, mostly fine, just the odd bit of pain. I have been very stressing lately. Kindly give your opinion.","To rule out the cardiac cause of your pain, you should do few tests.1) ECG (electrocardiogram).2. 2D echocardiography.3. TMT (treadmill test) or stress test.If all these three are normal, then it can be muscular pain or panic anxiety attacks."
27,"I am having pain on the left side of my chest from the last 2 to 3 days. I am not sure, but it seems a muscular pain because whenever I am moving my neck in a particular way or when I press my collar bone, the pain is more. I have a clerical job, and I have to sit a lot in front of the laptop. Last year, the same thing happened, so I got ECG, blood sugar, cholesterol, and other tests done, which were all normal. And the pain went away after 5 to 6 days. I am around 40 years of age and a non-smoker, non-drinker, and vegetarian. Please guide me how to get rid of this pain. The pain is very mild and not regular, but it is irritating and also causing tension. Should I do all the tests again? Please provide your valuable guidance. Thanks.","Older age can affect the risk of developing chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for CLL include the following:         - Being middle-aged or older, male, or white.    - A family history of CLL or cancer of the lymph system.    - Having relatives who are Russian Jews or Eastern European Jews."
28,"I am an 18 year old male, and I am overweight. I have been having sharp upper right chest pains, that are very frequent. I did not have them before, but I started getting them recently. At first, I was having shortness of breath, and it felt as if someone was standing on my chest. But now, I have bad sharp pains at night. They come and go intermittently. My doctor prescribed Baclofen and Omeprazole.","Your chest pain is a result of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Cardiac chest pain increases during respiration and comes with other symptoms like palpitations, etc.Omeprazole and Baclofen that your physician prescribed should reduce the symptoms you are experiencing. I will advise you continue with both medications for a week.If after a week it still persists, report to your physician in case he or she has to adjust the dosage or change the medication.I am a bit worried about your weight, you risk having a major cardiovascular event if you do not start losing weight immediately.

29,"I am a 24 year old male, who weighs 80 kg and I am 6 feet tall, and I have no previous cardiac problems. I have a slight chest pain, almost like the type caused by grief. I work a lot, especially over the last month. The pain has been on off all day since two weeks. I do not want to waste my time going to the hospital, and people keep telling me that it is stress. Should I go to the hospital?","I understand your worries, but there is absolutely nothing to worry.Chest pains can be caused by a lot of factors, from cardiovascular-related to non-cardiovascular related. For example heartburn, costochondritis, angina, etc.Your chest pain is non-cardiac because, in the case of cardiac-related chest pain you will have other accompanying symptoms like shortness of breath, and the chest pain that radiates to other parts of the body like jaw. Cardiac-related chest pains are more common in elderly patients.Your chest pain might be related to your work, too much stress can induce chest pain.I suggest you try taking tablet Ibuprofen 400 mg, two times a day for five days. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking medicine after their consent.If the pain does not subside or in the presence of additional symptoms, consult your general practitioner for evaluation."
30,"Yesterday, I got ""water in the wrong hole,"" coughed a bit, and felt fine again. Later at night, I had brief chest pain. Today morning after going to the toilet, I coughed up some yellow-colored mucus. I do not have a fever, my pulse is around 55 to 60 (lower than usual), and my SpO2 is 97%.","I do not think chest pain is anything related to this episode. Coughing after something gets into the trachea (air pipe) is a protective mechanism to protect the lungs. Even if it is connected, the reason could be muscle straining due to sudden intense coughing.I do not think the situation is anything of concern now, as you do not have fever, cough, and oxygen saturation is also normal. Some people will have a low heart rate, like what you mentioned. This is usually seen in athletes and people who run long distances regularly. It is suitable for the heart unless nothing else is causing low heart rates.I would suggest observing for the next 48 to 72 hours for fevers, chest pain, cough, brownish mucoid sputum. If you find any of these, kindly consult your doctor for evaluation. It could be pneumonia and can be treated with appropriate medications."

32,I have extreme shortness of breath and pain in my chest and back. Please help.,"Such clinical features may result from anxiety, stress, acid reflux, allergic reactions, anemia, respiratory diseases like pneumonia, pneumothorax, pulmonary embolism, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart diseases like heart attacks, arrhythmia, etc.Treatment depends on the cause. You can do some investigations like CXR (X-ray of the chest), HRCT (high-resolution computed tomography) of the chest, ECG (electrocardiogram), Echo (echocardiogram), CBC (complete blood count), CRP (c-reactive protein), etc., to find out the exact cause of your present issue and then treat them accordingly.Do you have any past history of the disease, other associated symptoms like cough, fever, etc., along with chest pain, history of acidity, history of regular bowel movement, anxiety or stress, etc.?

She is on regular Eltroxin 50.,"A pregnant woman needs a good balanced diet. Before going to that, I will suggest you one thing.As your wife is hypothyroid, the need for thyroid hormones increases by 50% in pregnancy. You need to increase the dose to 75 mcg. Go for a thyroid profile and adjust dose accordingly with the help of your doctor.Regarding diet plan, have a glass of milk 300 mL twice a day. It gives the calcium needed for pregnancy.

35,"I am a 19 year old male, and I weigh 140 lbs, and I am 5.7 feet tall. About three weeks ago, I went to the doctor for a fever, chills, and a headache. I was told that it was a minor case of flu. I developed blood in my mucus soon after, but I did not go to the doctor, as it went away after four days. Soon after that, I felt better. But recently, I have a cough with yellow phlegm, and I also have a pain in my right lung area, slightly below my chest when I cough or breath deeply. I was told this pain could be due to coughing too hard. I was wondering if these past two instances could be linked together? Does it indicate something serious such as lung cancer? Thanks.","It is a repeat lower respiratory tract infection, which is leading to both yellow phlegm and chest pain due to inflammation of pleura called as pleuritis.Chances of cancer are very less, provided your young age. Still, you should get one a chest x-ray done.I suggest you try using the following. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent.Capsule Augmentin 625 mg (combination of Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid), three times a day.Antacid like tablet Pantoprazole 40 mg, before breakfast, once a day for five days.Syrup Ascoril (combination of Phenylephrine, Triprolidine, and Dextromethorphan hydrobromide), two teaspoons whenever needed up to three times a day.Tablet Ibuprofen 400 mg, whenever needed up to three times a day.If you smoke, then you should quit smoking, as it is damaging your airways and leading to infection.Hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts."
36,Can a person get gonorrhea or chlamydia from a small wound and someones semen touches the wound? I heard that disseminated gonococcal infection can occur when it spreads into the bloodstream and it can be dangerous. Is this the way by which gonorrhea gets into the bloodstream? Best wishes.,"Yes, there are high chances of having sexually transmitted infection transmission when semen of infected individual comes in contact with open wounds and dissemination. We can never tell that it will always happen but the chances are very high. It depends upon the healing stage of the wound, cell-mediated and humoral immunity of the individual. More than gonorrhea and chlamydial infection, we need to be more concerned about syphilis, hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV (human immunodeficiency virus). Take care."
37,"I got a fever of 100 degrees Fahrenheit with body pain. Then, I took Calpol 650. After taking it, my temperature showed 105 degrees. What to do?","Thank you for the query. I can understand your concern. According to your statement, you are suffering from a fever that is very high in nature. As Acetaminophen or Paracetamol cannot subside your fever, I think that you should start taking broad-spectrum antibiotics like Azithromycin or Cefixime immediately. If your fever does not subside within five to six days, then you should undergo some investigations. If you have any other complications without high fever and body pain, then kindly tell me in detail. Take care. In case of any other query ask me."
38,I am a 21-year-old male. I do not have any medical history and I am not taking medicines for anything. My girlfriend got a positive result for chlamydia before few days and she was prescribed antibiotics. We are both asymptomatic now. Please suggest.,"I understand your concern. According to the statement, your girlfriend got a positive result for chlamydia recently. Patients with chlamydia infection may not know that they have it because they do not have any signs or symptoms. Chlamydia usually resolves within one to two weeks. You should avoid having sex during this period to prevent the transmission of the disease. Your doctor prescribes antibiotics once or twice a day for seven days. Then you need to wait for seven days before having sex again.The most commonly used antibiotics for chlamydia are Azithromycin. They are given with two or four tablets and it should be taken once or tablet Doxycycline has to be taken twice daily for a week. As your girlfriend has been affected with chlamydial infection, so you need to undergo some investigations such as urine R/M (urine routine and microscopy), C/S (culture and sensitivity), and urethral or prostatic swab for culture and sensitivity for confirming the diagnosis of chlamydia in you. After that, you can start having treatment."
39,I am a 27 year old female. I am getting acne since the age of 13. I have asthma. No product has worked on my face. I have sensitive oily skin. Kindly advice some solution.,"Acne has several grades depending on the type of lesions.In grade 1, I prefer to advise topical Clindamycin in the morning and Benzoyl peroxide alternatively with topical retinoids in the night-time.Oral antibiotics are also given like Doxycycline or Minocycline or Azithromycin in grade 2-4 acne.Avoid hair oil application and oily food in the diet.In responding cases, consideration is given to start oral retinoids.Kindly upload the images, so that I can actually visualize the lesions and advice you to my best. Also, mention the details of treatment you have already taken."
40,"I always have bad breath and a smelling mouth. Recently, I found stinky tonsil stones. Is there any antibiotic or treatment available to cure it?","Bad breath or halitosis is a problem where the breath is smelly. It has some causes from food to some disorders. As you have tonsil stones, you can have infections in it. It can be treated by using antibiotics. If you have a recurrent infection in the tonsil, then I suggest you visit an ENT specialist.If you are not allergic to antibiotics, you can take Azithromycin tablet once a day for three days. If the infection persists, continue taking it for six days. Take Montral (Montelukast with Levocetirizine) tablet daily after dinner for seven days. Do mouth gargles using Chlorhexidine mouthwash (1:1) two times daily. Maintain oral hygiene. Brush your teeth two times daily and floss it every day."
41,I had a sprain in my ankle three weeks ago. My ankle is still swollen slightly with mild pain and pressure. What is the issue?,"Repeated sprain over the same area can lead to increased instability and increased inflammation. If you do not have much pain, but if the swelling is still present, you can take an oral and topical anti-inflammatory (over-the-counter anti-inflammatory) for one week. And also, have a cold compress over the affected area. Take food rich in vitamins and minerals and say hydrated. Take good rest. And you will be fine in a few days."
42,"I am a male with a weight of 72 kilograms and a height of five feet nine inches. I have a grade 3 sprained ankle. On the first day, I had a severe swelling with a size of a softball as well as bruising. It started to appear overnight. On the fourth day, I consulted a doctor and took X-rays. The doctor told me it as a grade 3 sprain and he told me that it has a recovery time of 3 to 6 weeks. Currently, I am unable to bear my weight due to my swelling. My bruising remains the same. Even if my foot is not elevated, I have extreme pain. What is the reason?","As per the information, I suggest you follow PRICE protocol. Follow protection, rest, ice, compression, and elevation. I suggest you wear ankle support or brace or taping the ankle to have more stability and thus it accelerates healing. Try to move the foot within the brace gradually without stressing. Avoid bearing weight on the affected foot. If there is no improvement within a week, kindly consult an orthopedic surgeon or physiotherapist."
43,"Before seven months, I sprained my ankle due to a track and field injury. I postponed crutches for a week due to a trip the following day, but went on crutches the next week. I never went to see a doctor. I just went through PT with my athletic trainer. I spent three weeks without rigorous exercise and was able to return. The pain finally subsided after three months. But, it is still swollen and sometimes, painful to flex. Why?","Essentially, if one is able to ambulate after an injury, this is usually a ligament injury and not involving the bones. But, in my opinion, x-ray of the involved region should always be done to rule out a bony injury.So, once we can rule out that then depending upon pain and associated swelling, ligaments involved can be ascertained and treatment initiated accordingly.In any case, your swelling appears more visible on the outer side. So, probably lateral ligament complex is involved, which is also the most common ligament injury.Swelling can remain around the ankle region, since it is a subcutaneous joint and unless the ligaments have healed completely, it can recur.Now to understand exactly, we need x-rays initially and if that is fine, then MRI can be done to see the status of the lateral ligament complex. Alternatively, stress x-rays of the ankle can be done to see the joint opening etc.Lastly, I would like to state that the majority of the ankle injuries has to be managed conservatively with physical therapy and supportive management."
44,"My ankle started hurting last week, and it has gotten worse, it is very painful and uncomfortable to walk. My question is, do I need crutches? I am a girl.","Looking into your problem it seems you are badly in pain and looking for things can help you walk so you remember about crutches. As simple protocols use simple formula RICE rest, ice compression and elevation of your feet are key sutra.For severe sprains, you might need a brace for protection and stability its good to use ankle brace having binder together in it. You may need crutches until you can walk without pain. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can help to control pain and swelling. We need to evaluate ankle with Grade II or Grade III sprains.Grade III sprains with complete tears of the ligaments even might need surgery to repair the injured ligaments. One thing to remember is that always in most cases, follow-up rehabilitative exercises are to restore strength and range of motion in the sprained ankle-also help to prevent future ankle injuries. If it is not healed ,think of doing X-ray of ankle, you might not know sometime there can be hairline fracture too (stress fracture)."
45,"I have chronic ankle sprains in both the ankles. I have this for maybe a year now. I went to PT and have been doing exercises. But, about a week ago, my ankle began to pop. It is happening once in a while. It really hurts and I have to pause for a couple minutes for the pain to settle. Is this normal? Is there a way for me to prevent or calm this pain? I am taking Zoloft and Ibuprofen when needed. Please help.","I generally see many cases like this in my clinic. I give them a splint, rest, analgesics, anti-inflammatory tablets and ice pack till the swelling reduces to some extent. Then we get an x-ray and if necessary an MRI done to find out the exact cause.From the history you have mentioned, it seems that you have very weak ankles in particular or all the ligaments in general.Such recurrent sprains occur either due to some old untreated childhood injury or weak ligaments or muscles around the joint.I suggest you should get an x-ray or MRI to find out the reason. To prevent yourself from getting recurrent sprains, you should see a good physiotherapist and do the ankle strengthening exercises.You should eventually get back to normal in a few weeks. Nothing to worry about. Do get back to me after your reports are ready."
46,"I am a 27-year-old male, height is 1.75 and weight is 83. The doctor has diagnosed premature ejaculation problem. When I was engaged in self-masturbation, sperm came out within one minute. Sometimes feel it was over and it should be ejaculated. But nowadays I cannot stop self masturbation. The family is discussing marriage, so I was thinking about my sexual problem. I need solutions for premature ejaculation problem, and strengthen my penis.","Masturbation per se does not cause any sexual problem in the future life, so do not worry excessively about it. However, to manage premature ejaculation you can learn about the start-stop technique or squeeze technique. There are medications available for this purpose like Dapoxetine 30 mg one hour prior to sexual activity. Also, get yourself investigated to rule out medical conditions such as thyroid dysfunction or diabetes hypertension, etc. Also, try Keigal exercise to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles."

48,"I am experiencing pain in my abdomen, and it started immediately after intercourse for the past two days. I also have a bloated stomach without constipation. The pain is more significant in the lower abdomen.","Pelvic muscles contract during orgasm, which can cause pain.Pain after vaginal and anal sex is usually temporary and should clear when you change positions or allow your body to rest. I suggest you try different positions and avoid deep thrusting next time to help you feel better.But there are some harmful reasons as follows that need a proper evaluation;Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common cause of pain in the lower abdomen. PID is an infection of the upper genital tract in sexually active women.The pain can also be due to irritable bowel syndrome, which gives a range of gastrointestinal symptoms, including pain, bloating, fart, constipation, and cramping.Kindly wait for two more days for the pain to subside. If the pain persists, I suggest you get an abdomen ultrasound and pelvis scan and review from a gynecologist."
49,"I am having a discomfort and mild pain during ejaculation. I was diagnosed as having chronic prostatitis with seminal vesiculitis, and I was put on Quinolones for three months and an alpha-blocker (Alfuzosin) for five months. The urinary symptoms completely resolved, but discomfort and pain in the right inguinal region during ejaculation still persisted. My semen analysis, semen culture, trans rectal ultrasound are normal. Kindly opine.","As your urinary symptoms have resolved, and pain during ejaculation is localized to the inguinal region, it is very likely to be a muscular pain of the cremaster. This muscle suspends the testis, and contracts during ejaculation, more strongly in young men. Tthe pain of prostatitis is also possible, but less likely to be felt in the inguinal region.I suggest you ejaculate at least twice a week.Take tablet Pregabalin 75 mg at bed time for neuropathic pain, and use a loose cotton underwear that supports the testes and prevents the activity of the cremaster."
50,"I am a 33 year old male. I have dry eyes and irritation since the last five years, especially when I wake up in the mornings. I consulted with an eye care specialist, but they found nothing wrong. My sugar levels were checked five times, and it came back normal all the times, except for once. But, the doctor said it was nothing to worry about, and gave me eyedrops. It gave me only a temporary relief for four to five months. Then it is back. Please help.","Dryness of the eyes is a very common condition these days due to excessive use of mobile phones, television, and laptop. There is no permanent treatment for dryness.It may be normal if it persists for a few days. But, it might continue for a longer time, due to a change in the weather, exposure to direct air, excessive screen time, lack of adequate sleep or, the use of contact lens.I suggest the following:Use anti-glare glasses when using mobile phones, laptop, etc.Cold compresses.Blinking exercises.Avoid direct exposure to air.Use lubricating eye drops frequently, like Refresh tears (Carboxymethylcellulose sodium).Preventive measures work better than treatment, but both are equally necessary. Please feel free to ask more queries."
